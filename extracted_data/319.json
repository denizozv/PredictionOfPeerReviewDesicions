  "abstract": "Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network. To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural network architectures.",

      "text": "As humans, we need to pay attention in order to be able to adequately perceive our surroundings. Attention is therefore a key aspect of our visual experience, and closely relates to perception - we need to keep attention to build a visual representation, possessing detail and coherence. As artificial neural networks became more popular in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing in the recent years, artificial attention mechanisms started to be developed as well. Artificial attention lets a system attend to an object to examine it with greater detail. It has also become a research tool for understanding mechanisms behind neural networks, similar to attention used in psychology. One of the popular hypothesis there is that there are non-attentional and attentional perception processes. Non-attentional processes help to observe a scene in general and gather high-level information, which, when associated with other thinking processes, helps us to control the attention processes and navigate to a certain part of the scene. This implies that different observers with different knowledge, different goals, and therefore different attentional strategies can literally see the same scene differently. This brings us to the main topic of this paper: how attention differs within artificial vision systems, and can we use attention information in order to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks ? More specifically, can a teacher network improve the performance of another student network by providing to it information about where it looks, i.e., about where it concentrates its attention into ? To study these questions, one first needs to properly specify how attention is defined w.r.t. a given convolutional neural network. To that end, here we consider attention as a set of spatial maps that essentially try to encode on which spatial areas of the input the network focuses most for taking its output decision (e.g., for classifying an image), where, furthermore, these maps can be defined w.r.t. various layers of the network so that they are able to capture both low-, mid-, and high-level representation information. More specifically, in this work we define two types of spatial attention maps: activation-based and gradient-based. We explore how both of these attention maps change over various datasets and architectures, and show that these actually contain valuable information that can be used for significantly improving the performance of convolutional neural network architectures (of various types and trained for various different tasks). To that end, we propose several novel ways of transferring attention from a powerful teacher network to a smaller student network with the goal of improving the performance of the latter (Fig. 1). To summarize, the contributions of this work are as follows: We propose attention as a mechanism of transferring knowledge from one network to another We propose the use of both activation-based and gradient-based spatial attention maps We show experimentally that our approach provides significant improvements across a va- riety of datasets and deep network architectures, including both residual and non-residual networks We show that activation-based attention transfer gives better improvements than fullactivation transfer, and can be combined with knowledge distillation The rest of the paper is structured as follows: we first describe related work in section 2, we explain our approach for activation-based and gradient-based attention transfer in section 3, and then present experimental results for both methods in section 4. We conclude the paper in section 5.",

      "text": "Early work on attention based tracking Larochelle & Hinton (2010), Denil et al. (2012) was motivated by human attention mechanism theories Rensink (2000) and was done via Restricted Bolzmann Machines. It was recently adapted for neural machine translation with recurrent neural networks, e.g. Bahdanau et al. (2014) as well as in several other NLP-related tasks. It was also exploited in computer-vision-related tasks such as image captioning Xu et al. (2015), visual question answering Yang et al. (2015), as well as in weakly-supervised object localization Oquab et al. (2015) and classification Mnih et al. (2014), to mention a few characteristic examples. In all these tasks attention proved to be useful. Visualizing attention maps in deep convolutional neural networks is an open problem. The simplest gradient-based way of doing that is by computing a Jacobian of network output w.r.t. input (this leads to attention visualization that are not necessarily class-discriminative), as for example in Simonyan et al. (2014). Another approach was proposed by Zeiler & Fergus (2014) that consists of attaching a network called deconvnet that shares weights with the original network and is used to project certain features onto the image plane. A number of methods was proposed to improve gradientbased attention as well, for example guided backpropagation Springenberg et al. (2015), adding a change in ReLU layers during calculation of gradient w.r.t. previous layer output. Attention maps obtained with guided backpropagation are non-class-discriminative too. Among existing methods for visualizing attention, we should also mention class activation maps Zhou et al. (2016), which are based on removing top average-pooling layer and converting the linear classification layer into a convolutional layer, producing attention maps per each class. A method combining both guided backpropagation and CAM is Grad-CAM by Selvaraju et al. (2016), adding image-level details to class-discriminative attention maps. Knowledge distillation with neural networks was pioneered by Hinton et al. (2015); Bucila et al. (2006), which is a transfer learning method that aims to improve the training of a student network by relying on knowledge borrowed from a powerful teacher network. Although in certain special cases shallow networks had been shown to be able to approximate deeper ones without loss in accuracy Lei & Caruana (2014), later work related to knowledge distillation was mostly based on the assumption that deeper networks always learn better representations. For example, FitNets Romero et al. (2014) tried to learn a thin deep network using a shallow one with more parameters. The introduction of highway Srivastava et al. (2015) and later residual networks He et al. (2015) allowed training very deep architectures with higher accuracy, and generality of these networks was experimentally showed over a large variety of datasets. Although the main motivation for residual networks was increasing depth, it was later shown by Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016) that, after a certain depth, the improvements came mostly from increased capacity of the networks, i.e. number of parameters (for instance, a wider deep residual network with only 16 layers was shown that it could learn as good or better representations as very thin 1000 layer one, provided that they were using comparable number of parameters). Due to the above fact and due to that thin deep networks are less parallelizable than wider ones, we think that knowledge transfer needs to be revisited, and take an opposite to FitNets approach - we try to learn less deep student networks. Our attention maps used for transfer are similar to both gradient-based and activation-based maps mentioned above, which play a role similar to hints in FitNets, although we dont introduce new weights.",

      "text": "Let us consider a CNN layer and its corresponding activation tensor A RCHW , which consists of C feature planes with spatial dimensionsHW . An activation-based mapping function F (w.r.t. that layer) takes as input the above 3D tensor A and outputs a spatial attention map, i.e., a flattened 2D tensor defined over the spatial dimensions, or F : RCHW RHW . (1) To define such a spatial attention mapping function, the implicit assumption that we make in this section is that the absolute value of a hidden neuron activation (that results when the network is evaluated on given input) can be used as an indication about the importance of that neuron w.r.t. the specific input. By considering, therefore, the absolute values of the elements of tensor A, we can construct a spatial attention map by computing statistics of these values across the channel dimension (see Fig. 3). More specifically, in this work we will consider the following activation-based spatial attention maps: sum of absolute values: Fsum(A) = C i=1 |Ai| sum of absolute values raised to the power of p (where p > 1): F psum(A) = C i=1 |Ai|p max of absolute values raised to the power of p (where p > 1): F pmax(A) = maxi=1,C |Ai|p where Ai = A(i, :, :) (using Matlab notation), and max, power and absolute value operations are elementwise (e.g. |Ai|p is equivalent to abs(Ai).p in Matlab notation). We visualized activations of various networks on several datasets, including ImageNet classification and localization, COCO object detection, face recognition, and fine-grained recognition. We were mostly focused on modern architectures without top dense linear layers, such as Network-InNetwork, ResNet and Inception, which have streamlined convolutional structure. We also examined networks of the same architecture, width and depth, but trained with different frameworks with significant difference in performance. We found that the above statistics of hidden activations not only have spatial correlation with predicted objects on image level, but these correlations also tend to be higher in networks with higher accuracy, and stronger networks have peaks in attention where weak networks dont (e.g., see Fig. 4). Furthermore, attention maps focus on different parts for different layers in the network. In the first layers neurons activation level is high for low-level gradient points, in the middle it is higher for the most discriminative regions such as eyes or wheels, and in the top layers it reflects full objects. For example, mid-level attention maps of a network trained for face recognition Parkhi et al. (2015) will have higher activations around eyes, nose and lips, and top level activation will correspond to full face (Fig. 2). Concerning the different attention mapping functions defined above, these can have slightly different properties. E.g.: Compared to Fsum(A), the spatial map F psum(A) (where p > 1) puts more weight to spatial locations that correspond to the neurons with the highest activations, i.e., puts more weight to the most discriminative parts (the larger the p the more focus is placed on those parts with highest activations). Furthermore, among all neuron activations corresponding to the same spatial location, F pmax(A) will consider only one of them to assign a weight to that spatial location (as opposed to F psum(A) that will favor spatial locations that carry multiple neurons with high activations). To further illustrate the differences of these functions we visualized attention maps of 3 networks with sufficient difference in classification performance: Network-In-Network (62% top-1 val accuracy), ResNet34 (73% top-1 val accuracy) and ResNet-101 (77.3% top-1 val accuracy). In each network we took last pre-downsampling activation maps, on the left for mid-level and on the right for top pre-average pooling activations in fig. 4. Top-level maps are blurry because their original spatial resolution is 7 7. It is clear that most discriminative regions have higher activation levels, e.g. face of the wolf, and that shape details disappear as the parameter p (used as exponent) increases. In attention transfer, given the spatial attention maps of a teacher network (computed using any of the above attention mapping functions), the goal is to train a student network that will not only make correct predictions but will also have attentions maps that are similar to those of the teacher. In general, one can place transfer losses w.r.t. attention maps computed across several layers. For instance, in the case of ResNet architectures, one can consider the following two cases, depending on the depth of teacher and student: Same depth: possible to have attention transfer layer after every residual block Different depth: have attention transfer on output activations of each group of residual blocks Similar cases apply also to other architectures (such as NIN, in which case a group refers to a block of a 3 3, 1 1, 1 1 convolutions). In fig. 5 we provide a schematic illustration of the different depth case for residual network architectures. Without loss of generality, we assume that transfer losses are placed between student and teacher attention maps of same spatial resolution, but, if needed, attention maps can be interpolated to match their shapes. Let S, T and WS , WT denote student, teacher and their weights correspondingly, and let L(W, x) denote a standard cross entropy loss. Let also I denote the indices of all teacher-student activation layer pairs for which we want to transfer attention maps. Then we can define the following total loss: LAT = L(WS , x) + 2 jI QjS QjS2 QjT QjT 2 p , (2) where QjS = vec(F (A j S)) and Q j T = vec(F (A j T )) are respectively the j-th pair of student and teacher attention maps in vectorized form, and p refers to norm type (in the experiments we use p = 2). As can be seen, during attention transfer we make use of l2-normalized attention maps, i.e., we replace each vectorized attention map Q with QQ2 (l1 normalization could be used as well). It is worth emphasizing that normalization of attention maps is important for the success of the student training. Attention transfer can also be combined with knowledge distillation Hinton et al. (2015), in which case an additional term (corresponding to the cross entropy between softened distributions over labels of teacher and student) simply needs to be included to the above loss. When combined, attention transfer adds very little computational cost, as attention maps for teacher can be easily computed during forward propagation, needed for distillation.",

      "text": "In this case we define attention as gradient w.r.t. input, which can be viewed as an input sensitivity map Simonyan et al. (2014), i.e., attention at an input spatial location encodes how sensitive the output prediction is w.r.t. changes at that input location (e.g., if small changes at a pixel can have a large effect on the network output then it is logical to assume that the network is paying attention to that pixel). Lets define the gradient of the loss w.r.t input for teacher and student as: JS = x L(WS, x), JT = x L(WT, x) (3) Then if we want student gradient attention to be similar to teacher attention, we can minimize a distance between them (here we use l2 distance but other distances can be employed as well): LAT (WS,WT, x) = L(WS, x) + 2 ||JS JT ||2 (4) As WT and x are given, to get the needed derivative w.r.t. WS : WS LAT = WS L(WS, x) + (JS JT ) 2 WSx L(WS, x) (5) So to do an update we first need to do forward and back propagation to get JS and JT , compute the second error 2 ||JS JT ||2 and propagate it second time. The second propagation is similar to forward propagation in this case, and involves second order mixed partial derivative calculation 2 WSx . The above computation is similar to the double backpropagation technique developed by Drucker & LeCun (1992) (where the l2 norm of the gradient w.r.t. input is used as regularizer). Furthermore, it can be implemented efficiently in a framework with automatic differentiation support, even for modern architectures with sophisticated graphs. The second backpropagation has approximately the same cost with first backpropagation, excluding forward propagation. We also propose to enforce horizontal flip invariance on gradient attention maps. To do that we propagate horizontally flipped images as well as originals, backpropagate and flip gradient attention maps back. We then add l2 losses on the obtained attentions and outputs, and do second backpropagation: Lsym(W, x) = L(W, x) + 2 || x L(W, x) flip( x L(W,flip(x)))||2 , (6) where flip(x) denotes the flip operator. This is similar to Group Equivariant CNN approach by Cohen & Welling (2016), however it is not a hard constraint. We experimentally find that this has a regularization effect on training. We should note that in this work we consider only gradients w.r.t. the input layer, but in general one might have the proposed attention transfer and symmetry constraints w.r.t. higher layers of the network.",

In all combinations, attention transfer (AT) shows significant improvements, which are also higher when it is combined with knowledge distillation (AT+KD). To verify if having at least one activation-based attention transfer loss per group in WRN transfer is important, we trained three networks with only one transfer loss per network in group1, group2 and group3 separately, and compared to a network trained with all three losses. The corresponding results were 8.11, 7.96, 7.97 (for the separate losses) and 7.93 for the combined loss (using WRN16-2/WRN-16-1 as teacher/student pair). Each loss provides some additional degree of attention transfer. We also explore which attention mapping functions tend to work best using WRN-16-1 and WRN16-2 as student and teacher networks respectively (table 2). Interestingly, sum-based functions work very similar, and better than max-based ones. From now on, we will use sum of squared attention mapping function F 2sum for simplicity. As for parameter in eq. 2, it usually varies about 0.1, as we set it to 103 divided by number of elements in attention map and batch size for each layer.

For networks of the same width different depth we tried to regress directly to activations, without 1 1 convolutions.

In future we plan to explore gradient-based attention for teacher-student pairs that make use of batch normalization, because it is so far unclear how batch normalization should behave in the second backpropagation step required during gradientbased attention transfer (e.g., should it contribute to batch normalization parameters, or is a separate forward propagation with fixed parameters needed). We explored the following methods: Minimizing l2 norm of gradient w.r.t. input, i.e. the double backpropagation method Drucker & LeCun (1992); Symmetry norm on gradient attention maps (see eq. 6); Student-teacher gradient-based attention transfer; Student-teacher activation-based attention transfer. Results for various methods are shown in table 3. Interestingly, just minimizing l2 norm of gradient already works pretty well. Also, symmetry norm is one the best performing attention norms, which we plan to investigate in future on other datasets as well. We also observe that, similar to activationbased attention transfer, using gradient-based attention transfer leads to improved performance. We also trained a network with activation-based AT in the same training conditions, which resulted in the best performance among all methods. We should note that the architecture of student NIN without batch normalization is slightly different from teacher network, it doesnt have ReLU activations before pooling layers, which leads to better performance without batch normalization, and worse with.

Batch normalization layers are fixed for finetuning, and first group of residual blocks is frozen. We then took finetuned ResNet-34 networks and used them as teachers for ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet, with F 2sum attention losses on 2 last groups. In both cases attention transfer provides significant improvements, closing the gap between ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 in accuracy.

On CIFAR both AT and KD work well in this case and improve convergence and final accuracy, on ImageNet though KD converges significantly slower (we did not train until the end due to lack of computational resources).

Code and models for our experiments are available at https://github.com/szagoruyko/attention-transfer.",
