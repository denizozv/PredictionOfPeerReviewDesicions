      "text": "Deep generative models trained via Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) (Kingma & Welling, 2014a; Rezende et al., 2014) efficiently couple the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the robustness to uncertainty of probabilistic latent variables. This combination has lead to their success in tasks ranging from image generation (Gregor et al., 2015; Rezende et al., 2016) to semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014; Maale et al., 2016) to language modeling (Bowman et al., 2016). Various extensions to SGVB have been proposed (Burda et al., 2016; Maale et al., 2016; Salimans et al., 2015), but one conspicuous absence is an extension to Bayesian nonparametric processes. Using SGVB to perform inference for nonparametric distributions is quite attractive. For instance, SGVB allows for a broad class of non-conjugate approximate posteriors and thus has the potential to expand Bayesian nonparametric models beyond the exponential family distributions to which they are usually confined. Moreover, coupling nonparametric processes with neural network inference models equips the networks with automatic model selection properties such as a selfdetermined width, which we explore in this paper. We make progress on this problem by first describing how to use SGVB for posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes (Ishwaran & James, 2001). This is not a straightforward task as the Beta distribution, the natural choice for an approximate posterior, does not have the differentiable non-centered parametrization that SGVB requires. We bypass this obstacle by using the little-known Kumaraswamy distribution (Kumaraswamy, 1980). Using the Kumaraswamy as an approximate posterior, we then reformulate two popular deep generative modelsthe Variational Autoencoder (Kingma & Welling, 2014a) and its semi-supervised variant (model M2 proposed by Kingma et al. (2014))into their nonparametric analogs. These models perform automatic model selection via an infinite capacity hidden layer that employs as many stick segments (latent variables) as the data requires. We experimentally show that, for datasets of natural images, stick-breaking priors improve upon previously proposed deep generative models by having a latent representation that better preserves class boundaries and provides beneficial regularization for semi-supervised learning.",

Together the two form a computational pipeline that resembles an unsupervised autoencoder (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006). The generative process can be written mathematically as zi p(z) , xi p(x|zi) (1) where p(z) is the prior and p(x|zi) is the density network with parameters .

SGVB is distinguished from classical variational Bayes by its use of differentiable Monte Carlo (MC) expectations. To elaborate, consider SGVBs approximation of the usual evidence lowerbound (ELBO) (Jordan et al., 1999): L(,;xi) = 1 S S s=1 log p(xi|zi,s)KL(q(zi|xi)||p(z)) (2) for S samples of zi and where KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. An essential requirement of SGVB is that the latent variable be represented in a differentiable, non-centered parametrization (DNCP) (Kingma & Welling, 2014b); this is what allows the gradients to be taken through the MC expectation, i.e.: S s=1 log p(xi|zi,s) = S s=1 zi,s log p(xi|zi,s) zi,s . In other words, z must have a functional form that deterministically exposes the variational distributions parameters and allows the randomness to come from draws from some fixed distribution.

The ks are random weights independent of G0, chosen such that 0 k 1, and k k = 1 almost surely. SBPs have been termed as such because of their constructive definition known as the stick-breaking process (Sethuraman, 1994). Mathematically, this definition implies that the weights can be drawn according to the following iterative procedure: k = v1 if k = 1 vk j 1 (3) where vk Beta(, ). When vk Beta(1, 0), then we have the stick-breaking construction for the Dirichlet Process (Ferguson, 1973).

However, this representation still does not admit a DNCP as the Gamma distribution does not have one with respect to its shape parameter. Knowles (2015) suggests that when the shape parameter is near zero, the following asymptotic approximation of the inverse CDF is a suitable DNCP: F1(u) (ua(a)) 1 a b (4) for u Uniform(0, 1), shape parameter a, and scale parameter b.

Firstly, an inference network computes the parameters of K fraction distributions and samples values vi,k according to one of the parametrizations in Section 3. Next, a linear-time operation composes the stick segments from the sampled fractions: i = (i,1, i,2, . . . , i,K) = vi,1, vi,2(1 vi,1), . . . ,K1 j=1 (1 vi,j) . (9) The computation path is summarized in Figure 1 (c) with arrows denoting the direction of feedforward computation. The gray blocks represent any deterministic function that can be trained with gradient descenti.e. one or more neural network layers. Optimization of the SB-VAE is done just as for the VAE, by optimizing Equation 2 w.r.t. and . The KL divergence term can be computed (or closely approximated) in closed-form for all three parametrizations under consideration; the Kumaraswamy-to-Beta KL divergence is given in the appendix. An important detail is that the Kth fraction vi,K is always set to one to ensure the stick segments sum to one. This truncation of the variational posterior does not imply that we are using a finite dimensional prior. As explained by Blei & Jordan (2006), the truncation level is a variational parameter and not part of the prior model specification. Truncation-free posteriors have been proposed, but these methods use split-and-merge steps (Hughes et al., 2015) or collapsed Gibbs sampling, both of which are not applicable to the models we consider. Nonetheless, because SGVB imposes few limitations on the inference model, it is possible to have an untruncated posterior. We conducted exploratory experiments using a truncation-free posterior by adding extra variational parameters in an on-line fashion, initializing new weights if more than 1% of the stick remained unbroken.

Although ys distribution is written as independent of z, the two share parameters within the inference network and thus act to regularize one another. We assume the same factorization of the posterior and use the same objectives as in the finite dimensional version (Kingma et al., 2014). Since yi is present for some but not all observations, semi-supervised DGMs need to be trained with different objectives depending on whether the label is present or not. If the label is present, following Kingma et al. (2014) we optimize J (,;xi, yi) = 1 S S s=1 log p(xi|i,s, yi)KL(q(i|xi)||p(i;0)) + log q(yi|xi) (10) where log q(yi|xi) is the log-likelihood of the label.

There has been work on using nonparametric posterior approximationsin particular, the Variational Gaussian Process (Tran et al., 2016)but in that work the variational distribution is nonparametric, not the generative model. Moreover, we are not aware of prior work that uses SGVB for Beta (or Beta-like) random variables1. In regards to the autoencoder implementations we describe, they are closely related to the existing work on representation learning with adaptive latent factorsi.e. where the number of latent dimensions grows as the data necessitates. The best known model of this kind is the infinite binary latent feature model defined by the Indian Buffet Process (Ghahramani & Griffiths, 2005); but its discrete latent variables prevent this model from admitting fully differentiable inference. Recent work that is much closer in spirit is the Infinite Restricted Boltzmann Machine (iRBM) (Cote & Larochelle, 2016), which has gradient-based learning, expands its capacity by adding hidden units, and induces a similar ordering on latent factors. The most significant difference between our SB-VAE and the iRBM is that the latters nonparametric behavior arises from a particular definition of the energy function of the Gibbs distribution, not from an infinite dimensional Bayesian prior. Lastly, our training procedure bears some semblance to Nested Dropout (Rippel et al., 2014), which removes all hidden units at an index lower than some threshold index. The SB-VAE can be seen as performing soft nested dropout since the latent variable values decrease as their index increases.",

In all experiments, to best isolate the effects of Gaussian versus stick-breaking latent variables, the same architecture and optimization hyperparameters were used for each model.

The inference and generative models both contained one hidden layer of 200 units for Frey Faces and 500 units for MNIST and MNIST+rot. For Frey Faces, the Gauss VAE had a 25 dimensional (factorized) distribution, and we set the truncation level of the SB-VAE also to K = 25, so the SB-VAE could use only as many latent variables as the Gauss VAE. For the MNIST datasets, the latent dimensionality/truncation-level was set at 50. Cross-validation chose 0 = 1 for Frey Faces and 0 = 5 for both MNISTs. Density Estimation. In order to show each models optimization progress, Figure 2 (a), (b), and (c) report test expected reconstruction error (i.e. the first term in the ELBO) vs training progress (epochs) for Frey Faces, MNIST, and MNIST+rot respectively. Optimization proceeds much the same in both models except that the SB-VAE learns at a slightly slower pace for all parametrizations. This is not too surprising since the recursive definition of the latent variables likely causes coupled gradients. We compare the final converged models in Table 1, reporting the marginal likelihood of each model via the MC approximation log p(xi) log 1S s p(xi|zi,s)p(zi,s)/q(zi,s) using 100 samples.

Note that the likelihoods reported are worse than the ones reported by Burda et al. (2016) because our training set consisted of 50k examples whereas theirs contained 60k (training and validation). We also investigated whether the SB-VAE is using its adaptive capacity in the manner we expect, i.e., the SB-VAE should use a larger latent dimensionality for the rotated images in MNIST+rot than it does for the non-rotated ones. We examined if this is the case by tracking how many breaks it took the model to deconstruct 99% of the stick. On average, the rotated images in the training set were represented by 28.7 dimensions and the non-rotated by 27.4. Furthermore, the rotated images used more latent variables in eight out of ten classes. Although the difference is not as large as we were expecting, it is statistically significant. Moreover, the difference is made smaller by the non-rotated one digits, which use 32 dimensions on average, the most for any class. The non-rotated average decreases to 26.3 when ones are excluded. Figure 3 (a) shows MNIST digits drawn from the SB-VAE by sampling from the priori.e. vk Beta(1, 5), and Figure 3 (b) shows Gauss VAE samples for comparison. SB-VAE samples using all fifty dimensions of the truncated posterior are shown in the bottom block. Samples from Dirichlets constrained to a subset of the dimensions are shown in the two columns in order to test that the latent features are concentrating onto lower-dimensional simplices. This is indeed the case: adding a latent variable results in markedly different but still coherent samples. For instance, the second and third dimensions seem to capture the 7-class, the fourth and fifth the 6-class, and the eighth the 5-class. The seventh dimension seems to model notably thick digits. Discriminative Qualities. The discriminative qualities of the models latent spaces are assessed by running a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier on (sampled) MNIST latent variables. Results are shown in the table in Figure 4 (a). The SB-VAE exhibits conspicuously better performance than the Gauss VAE at all choices of k, which suggests that although the Gauss VAE converges to a better likelihood, the SB-VAEs latent space better captures class structure.

The GMVAE6 has sixteen mixture components and the DLGMM has five, and hence both have many more parameters than the SB-VAE. Despite the SB-VAEs lower capacity, we see that its performance is competitive to the mixture VAEs (8.65 vs 8.38/8.96). The discriminative qualities of the SB-VAEs latent space are further supported by Figures 4 (b) and (c). t-SNE was used to embed the Gaussian (c) and stick-breaking (b) latent MNIST representations into two dimensions. Digit classes (denoted by color) in the stick-breaking latent space are clustered with noticeably more cohesion and separation. Combating Decoder Pruning. The component collapsing behavior of the variational autoencoder has been well noted (Maale et al., 2016): the model will set to zero the outgoing weights of latent variables that remain near the prior. Figure 5 (a) depicts this phenomenon for the Gauss VAE by plotting the KL divergence from the prior and outgoing decoder weight norm for each latent dimension. We see the weights are only nonzero in the dimensions in which there is posterior deviation. Ostensibly the model receives only sampling noise from the dimensions that remain at the prior, and setting the decoder weights to zero quells this variance. While the behavior of the Gauss VAE is not necessarily improper, all examples are restricted to pass through the same latent variables. A sparse-coded representationone having few active components per example (like the Gauss VAE) but diversity of activations across exampleswould likely be better. We compare the activation patterns against the sparsity of the decoder for the SB-VAE in Figure 5 (b). Since KL-divergence doesnt directly correspond to sparsity in stick-breaking latent variables like it does for Gaussian ones, the black lines denote the average activation value per dimension. Similarly to (a), blue lines denoted the decoder weight norms, but they had to be down-scaled by a factor of 100 so they could be visualized on the same plot. The SB-VAE does not seem to have any component collapsing, which is not too surprising since the model can set latent variables to zero to deactivate decoder weights without being in the heart of the prior. We conjecture that this increased capacity is 6The GMVAEs evaluation is different from performing kNN. Rather, test images are assigned to clusters and whole clusters are given a label.
