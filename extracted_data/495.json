  "title": "Why Deep Neural Networks for Function Approximation?",
  "abstract": "Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of $\\varepsilon$ uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on $\\varepsilon$) require $\\Omega(\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with $1/\\varepsilon$) require $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{polylog}(1/\\varepsilon))$ neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.",

      "text": "Neural networks have drawn significant interest from the machine learning community, especially due to their recent empirical successes (see the surveys (Bengio, 2009)). Neural networks are used to build state-of-art systems in various applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language process and others (see, Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Goodfellow et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2013, for example). The result that neural networks are universal approximators is one of the theoretical results most frequently cited to justify the use of neural networks in these applications. Numerous results have shown the universal approximation property of neural networks in approximations of different function classes, (see, e.g., Cybenko 1989; Hornik et al. 1989; Funahashi 1989; Hornik 1991; Chui & Li 1992; Barron 1993; Poggio et al. 2015). All these results and many others provide upper bounds on the network size and assert that small approximation error can be achieved if the network size is sufficiently large. More recently, there has been much interest in understanding the approximation capabilities of deep versus shallow networks. Delalleau & Bengio (2011) have shown that there exist deep sum-product networks which cannot be approximated by shallow sum-product networks unless they use an exponentially larger amount of units or neurons. Montufar et al. (2014) have shown that the number of linear region increases exponentially with the number of layers in the neural network. Telgarsky (2016) has established such a result for neural networks, which is the subject of this paper. Eldan & Shamir (2015) have shown that, to approximate a specific function, a two-layer network requires an exponential number of neurons in the input dimension, while a three-layer network requires a polynomial number of neurons. These recent papers demonstrate the power of deep networks by showing that depth can lead to an exponential reduction in the number of neurons required, for specific functions or specific neural networks. Our goal here is different: we are interested in function approximation specifically and would like to show that for a given upper bound on the approximation error, shallow networks require exponentially more neurons than deep networks for a large class of functions. The multilayer neural networks considered in this paper are allowed to use either rectifier linear units (ReLU) or binary step units (BSU), or any combination of the two. The main contributions of this paper are We have shown that, for -approximation of functions with enough piecewise smoothness, a multilayer neural network which uses (log(1/)) layers only needs O(poly log(1/)) neurons, while (poly(1/)) neurons are required by neural networks with o(log(1/)) layers. In other words, shallow networks require exponentially more neurons than a deep network to achieve the level of accuracy for function approximation. We have shown that for all differentiable and strongly convex functions, multilayer neural networks need (log(1/)) neurons to achieve an -approximation. Thus, our results for deep networks are tight. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present necessary definitions and the problem statement. In Section 3, we present upper bounds on network size, while the lower bound is provided in Section 4. Conclusions are presented in Section 5. Around the same time that our paper was uploaded in arxiv, a similar paper was also uploaded in arXiv by Yarotsky (2016). The results in the two papers are similar in spirit, but the details and the general approach are substantially different.",

Given a function f , our goal is to understand whether a multilayer neural network f of depth L and size N exists such that it solves min fF(N,L) f f .

Obviously, tight bounds in the answers to these two questions provide tight bounds on the network size and depth required for function approximation. Besides, solutions to these two questions together can be further used to answer the following question.

      "text": "In this subsection, we present all results on approximating univariate functions. We first present a theorem on the size of the network for approximating a simple quadratic function. As part of the proof, we present the structure of the multilayer feedforward neural network used and show how the neural network parameters are chosen. Results on approximating general functions can be found in Theorem 2 and 4. Theorem 1. For function f(x) = x2, x [0, 1], there exists a multilayer neural network f(x) with O ( log 1 ) layers, O ( log 1 ) binary step units and O ( log 1 ) rectifier linear units such that |f(x) f(x)| , x [0, 1]. Proof. The proof is composed of three parts. For any x [0, 1], we first use the multilayer neural network to approximate x by its finite binary expansion n i=0 xi 2i . We then construct a 2-layer neural network to implement function f (n i=0 xi 2i ) . For each x [0, 1], x can be denoted by its binary expansion x = i=0 xi 2i , where xi 0, 1 for all i 0. It is straightforward to see that the n-layer neural network shown in Figure 1 can be used to find x0, ..., xn. Next, we implement the function f(x) = f (n i=0 xi 2i ) by a two-layer neural network. Since f(x) = x2, we then rewrite f(x) as follows: f(x) = ( n i=0 xi 2i )2 = n i=0 xi 1 2i n j=0 xj 2j = n i=0 max 0, 2(xi 1) + 1 2i n j=0 xj 2j . The third equality follows from the fact that xi 0, 1 for all i. Therefore, the function f(x) can be implemented by a multilayer network containing a deep structure shown in Figure 1 and another hidden layer with n rectifier linear units. This multilayer neural network has O(n) layers, O(n) binary step units and O(n) rectifier linear units. Finally, we consider the approximation error of this multilayer neural network, |f(x) f(x)| = x2 ( n i=0 xi 2i )2 2 x n i=0 xi 2i = 2 i=n+1 xi 2i 12n1 . Therefore, in order to achieve -approximation error, one should choose n = log2 1 + 1. In summary, the deep neural network hasO ( log 1 ) layers,O ( log 1 ) binary step units andO ( log ( 1 )) rectifier linear units. Next, a theorem on the size of the network for approximating general polynomials is given as follows. Theorem 2. For polynomials f(x) = p i=0 aix i, x [0, 1] and p i=1 |ai| 1, there exists a multilayer neural network f(x) withO ( p+ log p ) layers, O ( log p ) binary step units andO ( p log p ) rectifier linear units such that |f(x) f(x)| , x [0, 1]. Proof. The proof is composed of three parts. We first use the deep structure shown in Figure 1 to find the n-bit binary expansion n i=0 aix i of x. Then we construct a multilayer network to approximate polynomials gi(x) = xi, i = 1, ..., p. Finally, we analyze the approximation error. Using the same deep structure shown in Figure 1, we could find the binary expansion sequence x0, ..., xn. In this step, we used n binary steps units in total. Now we rewrite gm+1( n i=0 xi 2n ), gm+1 ( n i=0 xi 2i ) = n j=0 [ xj 1 2j gm ( n i=0 xi 2i )] = n j=0 max [ 2(xj 1) + 1 2j gm ( n i=0 xi 2i ) , 0 ] . (2) Clearly, the equation (2) defines iterations between the outputs of neighbor layers. Therefore, the deep neural network shown in Figure 2 can be used to implement the iteration given by (2). Further, to implement this network, one should useO(p) layers withO(pn) rectifier linear units in total. We now define the output of the multilayer neural network as f(x) = p i=0 aigi (n j=0 xj 2j ) . For this multilayer network, the approximation error is |f(x) f(x)| = p i=0 aigi n j=0 xj 2j p i=0 aix i p i=0 |ai| gi n j=0 xj 2j xi p 2n1 This indicates, to achieve -approximation error, one should choose n = log p + 1. Besides, since we used O(n + p) layers with O(n) binary step units and O(pn) rectifier linear units in total, this multilayer neural network thus has O ( p+ log p ) layers, O ( log p ) binary step units and O ( p log p ) rectifier linear units. In Theorem 2, we have shown an upper bound on the size of multilayer neural network for approximating polynomials. We can easily observe that the number of neurons in network grows as p log p with respect to p, the degree of the polynomial. We note that both Andoni et al. (2014) and Barron (1993) showed the sizes of the networks grow exponentially with respect to p if only 3-layer neural networks are allowed to be used in approximating polynomials. Besides, every function f with p + 1 continuous derivatives on a bounded set can be approximated easily with a polynomial with degree p. This is shown by the following well known result of Lagrangian interpolation. By this result, we could further generalize Theorem 2. The proof can be found in the reference (Gil et al., 2007). Lemma 3 (Lagrangian interpolation at Chebyshev points). If a function f is defined at points z0, ..., zn, zi = cos((i+ 1/2)/(n+ 1)), i [n], there exists a polynomial of degree not more than n such that Pn(zi) = f(zi), i = 0, ..., n. This polynomial is given by Pn(x) = n i=0 f(zi)Li(x) where Li(x) = n+1(x) (xzi)n+1(zi) and n+1(x) = n j=0(x zj). Additionally, if f is continuous on [1, 1] and n+ 1 times differentiable in (1, 1), then Rn = f Pn 1 2n(n+ 1)! f (n+1) , where f (n)(x) is the derivative of f of the nth order and the norm f is the l norm f = maxx[1,1] f(x). Then the upper bound on the network size for approximating more general functions follows directly from Theorem 2 and Lemma 3. Theorem 4. Assume that function f is continuous on [0, 1] and log 2 + 1 times differentiable in (0, 1). Let f (n) denote the derivative of f of nth order and f = maxx[0,1] f(x). If f (n) n! holds for all n [ log 2 + 1 ] , then there exists a deep neural network f with O ( log 1 ) layers, O ( log 1 ) binary step units, O (( log 1 )2) rectifier linear units such that f f . Proof. Let N = log 2 . From Lemma 3, it follows that there exists polynomial PN of degree N such that for any x [0, 1], |f(x) PN (x)| f (N+1) 2N (N + 1)! 1 2N . Let x0, ..., xN denote the first N + 1 bits of the binary expansion of x and define f(x) = PN (N i=0 xi 2N ) . In the following, we first analyze the approximation error of f and next show the implementation of this function. Let x = N i=0 xi 2i . The error can now be upper bounded by |f(x) f(x)| = |f(x) PN (x)| |f(x) f (x)|+ |f (x) PN (x)| f (1) x N i=0 xi 2i + 12N 12N + 12N In the following, we describe the implementation of f by a multilayer neural network. Since PN is a polynomial of degree N , function f can be rewritten as f(x) = PN ( N i=0 xi 2i ) = N n=0 cngn ( N i=0 xi 2i ) for some coefficients c0, ..., cN and gn = xn, n [N ]. Hence, the multilayer neural network shown in the Figure 2 can be used to implement f(x). Notice that the network usesO(N) layers withO(N) binary step units in total to decode x0,...,xN and O(N) layers with O(N2) rectifier linear units in total to construct the polynomial PN . Substituting N = log 2 , we have proved the theorem. Remark: Note that, to implement the architecture in Figure 2 using the definition of a feedforward neural network in Section 2, we need the gi, i [p] at the output. This can be accomplished by using O(p2) additional ReLUs. Since p = O(log(1/)), this doesnt change the order result in Theorem 4. Theorem 4 shows that any function f with enough smoothness can be approximated by a multilayer neural network containing polylog ( 1 ) neurons with error. Further, Theorem 4 can be used to show that for functions h1,...,hk with enough smoothness, then linear combinations, multiplications and compositions of these functions can as well be approximated by multilayer neural networks containing polylog ( 1 ) neurons with error. Specific results are given in the following corollaries. Corollary 5 (Function addition). Suppose that all functions h1, ..., hk satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4, and the vector Rk : 1 = 1, then for the linear combination f = k i=1 ihi, there exists a deep neural network f with O ( log 1 ) layers, O ( log 1 ) binary step units, O (( log 1 )2) rectifier linear units such that |f(x) f | , x [0, 1]. Remark: Clearly, Corollary 5 follows directly from the fact that the linear combination f satisfies the conditions in Theorem 4 if all the functions h1,...,hk satisfy those conditions. We note here that the upper bound on the network size for approximating linear combinations is independent of k, the number of component functions. Corollary 6 (Function multiplication). Suppose that all functions h1,...,hk are continuous on [0, 1] and 4k log2 4k + 4k + 2 log2 2 + 1 times differentiable in (0, 1). If h(n)i n! holds for all i [k] and n [ 4k log2 4k + 4k + 2 log2 2 + 1 ] then for the multiplication f = k i=1 hi, there exists a multilayer neural network f with O ( k log k + log 1 ) layers, O ( k log k + log 1 ) bi- nary step units and O ( (k log k)2 + ( log 1 )2) rectifier linear units such that |f(x) f(x)| , x [0, 1]. Corollary 7 (Function composition). Suppose that all functions h1, ..., hk : [0, 1] [0, 1] satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4, then for the composition f = h1 h2 ... hk, there exists a multilayer neural network f with O ( k log k log 1 + log k ( log 1 )2) layers, O ( k log k log 1 + log k ( log 1 )2) binary step units and O ( k2 ( log 1 )2 + ( log 1 )4) rectifier lin- ear units such that |f(x) f(x)| , x [0, 1]. Remark: Proofs of Corollary 6 and 7 can be found in the appendix. We observe that different from the case of linear combinations, the upper bound on the network size grows as k2 log2 k in the case of function multiplications and grows as k2 ( log 1 )2 in the case of function compositions where k is the number of component functions. In this subsection, we have shown a polylog ( 1 ) upper bound on the network size for approximation of both univariate polynomials and general univariate functions with enough smoothness. Besides, we have shown that linear combinations, multiplications and compositions of univariate functions with enough smoothness can as well be approximated with error by a multilayer neural network of size polylog ( 1 ) . In the next subsection, we will show the upper bound on the network size for approximating multivariate functions.",

Remark: The proof is given in the appendix. By further analyzing the results on the network size, we obtain the following results: (a) fixing degree p, N(d, ) = O ( dp+1 log d ) as d and (b) fixing input dimension d, N(p, ) = O ( pd log p ) as p . Similar results on approximating multivariate polynomials were obtained by Andoni et al. (2014) and Barron (1993). Barron (1993) showed that on can use a 3-layer neural network to approximate any multivariate polynomial with degree p, dimension d and network size dp/2. Andoni et al. (2014) showed that one could use the gradient descent to train a 3-layer neural network of size d2p/2 to approximate any multivariate polynomial. However, Theorem 9 shows that the deep neural network could reduce the network size from O (1/) to O ( log 1 ) for the same error. Besides, for a fixed input dimension d, the size of the 3-layer neural network used by Andoni et al. (2014) and Barron (1993) grows exponentially with respect to the degree p. However, the size of the deep neural network shown in Theorem 9 grows only polynomially with respect to the degree. Therefore, the deep neural network could reduce the network size from O(exp(p)) to O(poly(p)) when the degree p becomes large. Theorem 9 shows an upper bound on the network size for approximating multivariate polynomials. Further, by combining Theorem 4 and Corollary 7, we could obtain an upper bound on the network size for approximating more general functions. The results are shown in the following corollary. Corollary 10. Assume that all univariate functions h1, ..., hk : [0, 1] [0, 1], k 1, satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4. Assume that the multivariate polynomial l(x) : [0, 1]d [0, 1] is of degree p. For composition f = h1 h2 ... hk l(x), there exists a multilayer neural network f of depth O ( p+ log d+ k log k log 1 + log k ( log 1 )2) and of sizeN(k, p, d, ) such that |f(x)f(x)| for x [0, 1]d, where N(k, p, d, ) = O ( p2 ( p+ d 1 d 1 ) log pd + k2 ( log 1 )2 + ( log 1 )4) . Remark: Corollary 10 shows an upper bound on network size for approximating compositions of multivariate polynomials and general univariate functions. The upper bound can be loose due to the assumption that l(x) is a general multivariate polynomials of degree p. For some specific cases, the upper bound can be much smaller. We present two specific examples in the Appendix H and I. In this subsection, we have shown that a similar polylog ( 1 ) upper bound on the network size for -approximation of general multivariate polynomials and functions which are compositions of univariate functions and multivariate polynomials. The results in this section can be used to find a multilayer neural network of size polylog ( 1 ) which provides an approximation error of at most . In the next section, we will present lower bounds on the network size for approximating both univariate and multivariate functions. The lower bound together with the upper bound shows a tight bound on the network size required for function approximations. While we have presented results in both the univariate and multivariate cases for smooth functions, the results automatically extend to functions that are piecewise smooth, with a finite number of pieces. In other words, if the domain of the function is partitioned into regions, and the function is sufficiently smooth (in the sense described in the Theorems and Corollaries earlier) in each of the regions, then the results essentially remain unchanged except for an additional factor which will depend on the number of regions in the domain.",

Next, by combining the lower bounds and the upper bounds shown in the previous section, we could analytically show the advantages of deeper neural networks over shallower ones. The theorem below is inspired by a similar result (DasGupta & Schnitger, 1993) for univariate quadratic functions, where it is stated without a proof. Here we show that the result extends to general multivariate strongly convex functions. Theorem 11. Assume function f : [0, 1]d R is differentiable and strongly convex with parameter .

By Theorem 4, for m = 1, there exists a multilayer neural network F1 with at most T1(1) log3 3 layers, T2(1) log3 3 binary step units and T3(1) ( log3 3 )2 rectifier linear units such that |F1(x) F1(x)| , for x [0, 1]. Now we consider the cases for 2 m k. We assume for Fm1, there exists a multilayer neural network Fm1 with not more than T1(m 1) log3 3 m layers, T2(m 1) log3 3m binary step units and T3(m 1) ( log3 3m )2 rectifier linear units such that |Fm1(x) Fm1(x)| 3 , for x [0, 1]. Further we assume the derivative of Fm1 has an upper bound F m1 1. Then for Fm, since Fm(x) can be rewritten as Fm(x) = Fm1(hm(x)), and there exists a multilayer neural network hm with at most T1(1) log3 3 layers, T2(1) log3 3 binary step units and T3(1) ( log3 3 )2 rectifier linear units such that |hm(x) hm(x)| 3 , for x [0, 1], and hm (1 + /3).

As before, we first use the deep structure shown in Figure 1 to find the binary expansion of x and next use a multilayer neural network to approximate the polynomial. Let x = (x(1), ..., x(d)) and wi = (wi1, ..., wid). We could now use the deep structure shown in Figure 1 to find the binary expansion for each x(k), k [d]. Let x(k) = n r=0 x(k)r 2r denote the binary expansion of x(k), where x(k)r is the rth bit in the binary expansion of x(k). Obviously, to decode all the n-bit binary expansions of all x(k), k [d], we need a multilayer neural network with n layers and dn binary units in total. Besides, we let x = (x(1), ..., x(d)). Now we define f(x) = f(x) = p i=1 ( d k=1 wikx (k) ) . We further define gl(x) = l i=1 ( d k=1 wikx (k) ) . Since for l = 1, ..., p 1, gl(x) = l i=1 ( d k=1 wikx (k) ) l i=1 wi1 = 1, then we can rewrite gl+1(x), l = 1, ..., p 1 into gl+1(x) = l+1 i=1 ( d k=1 wikx (k) ) = d k=1 [ w(l+1)kx (k) gl(x) ] = d k=1 w(l+1)k n r=0 [ x(k)r gl(x) 2r ] = d k=1 w(l+1)k n r=0 max [ 2(x(k)r 1) + gl(x) 2r , 0 ] (7) Obviously, equation (7) defines a relationship between the outputs of neighbor layers and thus can be used to implement the multilayer neural network. In this implementation, we need dn rectifier linear units in each layer and thus dnp rectifier linear units. Therefore, to implement function f(x), we need p+ n layers, dn binary step units and dnp rectifier linear units in total. In the rest of proof, we consider the approximation error. Since for k = 1, ..., d and x [0, 1]d,f(x)x(k) = p j=1 wjk p i=1,i=j ( wTi x ) p j=1 |wjk| p, then |f(x) f(x)| = |f(x) f(x)| f2 x x2 pd 2n . By choosing n = log2 pd , we have |f(x) f(x)| . Since we use nd binary step units to convert the input to binary form and dnp neurons in function approximation, we thus use O ( d log pd ) binary step units and O ( pd log pd ) rectifier linear units in total. In addition, since we have used n layers to convert the input to binary form and p layers in the function approximation section of the network, the whole deep structure has O ( p+ log pd ) layers.",

We say the function g(x) has a break point at x = z if g is discontinuous at z or its derivative g is discontinuous at z. We first present the lower bound on the number of break pointsM() that the multilayer neural network f should have for -approximation of function f with error . We next relate the number of break points M() to the network depth L and the size N . Now we calculate the lower bound on M(). We first define 4 points x0, x1 = x0 + 2 /, x2 = x1 + 2 / and x3 = x2 + 2 /, > 1. We assume 0 x0 1 and 2 (x2 x1) = = 2 x2 x1 > 2 x2 x1 , then a f (x2). (9) Similarly, we can obtain a f (x1). By our assumption that f = ax+ b, x [x0, x3], then f(x3) f(x3) = f(x3) ax3 b = f(x3) f(x2) a(x3 x2) + f(x2) ax2 b f (x2)(x3 x2) + 2 (x3 x2)2 a(x3 x2) = (f (x2) a)(x3 x2) + 2 ( 2 / )2 (2 1) > The first inequality follows from strong convexity of f and f(x2) ax2 b . The second inequality follows from the inequality (9). Therefore, this leads to the contradiction. Thus there exists a break point in the interval [x2, x3]. Similarly, we could prove there exists a break point in the interval [x0, x1]. These indicate that to achieve -approximation in [0, 1], the multilayer neural network f should have at least 1 4 break points in [0, 1]. Therefore, M() 1 4 , > 1. Further, Telgarsky (2016) has shown that the maximum number of break points that a multilayer neural network of depth L and size N could have is (N/L)L. Thus, L and N should satisfy (N/L)L > 1 4 , > 1. Therefore, we have N L ( 16 ) 1 2L . Besides, letm = N/L. Since each layer in network should have at least 2 neurons, i.e.,m 2, then N m 2 log2 m log2 ( 16 ) log2 ( 16 ) . Now we consider the multivariate case d > 1.

By assumption, g(y) is a strongly convex function with parameter and for all y [0, 1], |g(y) g(y)| . Therefore, by results in the univariate case, we should have N L ( 16 ) 1 2L and N log2 ( 16 ) . (10) Now we have proved the theorem. Remark: We make the following remarks about the lower bound in the theorem. (1) if the depth L is fixed, as in shallow networks, the number of neurons required is ( (1/) 1 2L ) . (2) if we are allowed to choose L optimally to minimize the lower bound, we will choose L = 12 log( 16 ) and thus the lower bound will become (log 1 ), closed to the O(log 2 1 ) upper bound shown in Theorem 4.",
