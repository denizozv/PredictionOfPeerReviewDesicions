Nevertheless, methods from convex optimization such as gradient descent and Adam are widely used as building blocks for deep learning algorithms. This paper provides the first convergence guarantee applicable to modern convnets. The guarantee matches a lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The key technical tool is the neural Taylor approximation -- a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks -- and the associated Taylor loss. Experiments on a range of optimizers, layers, and tasks provide evidence that the analysis accurately captures the dynamics of neural optimization.  The second half of the paper applies the Taylor approximation to isolate the main difficulty in training rectifier nets: that gradients are shattered.

      "text": "Deep learning has achieved impressive performance on a range of tasks (LeCun et al., 2015). The workhorse underlying deep learning is gradient descent or backprop. Gradient descent has convergence guarantees in settings that are smooth, convex or both. However, modern convnets are neither smooth nor convex. Every winner of the ImageNet classification challenge since 2012 has used rectifiers which are not smooth (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2015). Even in convex settings, convergence for nonsmooth functions is lower-bounded by 1/ N (Bubeck, 2015). The papers main contribution is the first convergence result for modern convnets, Theorem 2. It applies to any neural net with a loss convex in the output of the net. The idea is simple: backprop constructs linear snapshots (gradients) of a neural nets landscape; section 2 introduces neural Taylor approximations which are used to construct Taylor losses as convex snapshots closely related to backprop. The online convex optimization framework (Zinkevich, 2003) then gives 1/ N convergence to the Taylor optimum, matching the lower bound in (Bubeck, 2015). Section 2.3 investigates the Taylor optimum and regret terms empirically. We observe that convergence to the Taylor optimum occurs at 1/ N in practice. The nonsmoothness of rectifier nets is perhaps underappreciated. Fig. 1 shows a piecewise-linear (PL) function and its gradient. The gradient is discontinuous or shattered. Shattering is problematic for accelerated and Hessian-based methods which speed up convergence by exploiting the relationship between gradients at nearby points (Sutskever et al., 2013). The success of these methods on rectifier networks requires explanation since gradients at (nearby) points on different sides of a kink are not related. Further, the number of kinks grows exponentially with network depth (Pascanu et al., 2014; Telgarsky, 2016). Section 3 addresses the success of adaptive optimizers in rectifier nets.1 Adaptive optimizers normalize gradients by their root-mean-square; e.g. AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam and RadaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011; Hinton et al., 2012; Kingma & Ba, 2015; Krummenacher et al., 2016). Dauphin et al. (2015) argue that RMSProp is successful because it approximates the equilibriation matrix diag(H2) which approximates the absolute Hessian |H| (Dauphin et al., 2014). However, the argument is at best part of the story when gradients are shattered. The only way an optimizer can estimate gradients of a shattered function is to compute them directly. Effective optimizers must therefore explore the space of smooth regions the bound in theorem 2 is only as good as the optimum over the Taylor losses encountered during backprop. Observations 1 and 2 relate smooth regions in rectifier nets and the Taylor losses to configurations of active neurons. We hypothesize that root-mean-square normalization increases exploration through the set of smooth regions in a rectifier nets landscape. Experiments in section 3.3 confirm the hypothesis.",

In this work, we analyze convnets as they are rather than proposing a more tractable, but potentially less useful, model. A Taylor decomposition for neural networks was proposed in Montavon et al. (2015). They treat inputs as variable instead of weights and study interpretability instead of convergence.

We relate adversarial methods to deep learning through the Taylor loss. Intuitively, backprop searches a vast nonconvex landscape with a linear flashlight (Taylor losses are a more sharply focused convex flashlight, see A.4). The adversary is the landscape: from backprops perspective its geometry is an unpredictable external force. The Taylor losses are convex problems that backprop de facto optimizes the gradients of the actual and Taylor losses are identical. The Taylor optimum improves when, stepping over a kink, backprop shines its light on a new (better) region of the landscape (fig. 2). Regret quantifies the gap between the Taylor optimal loss and the losses incurred during training. 1For simplicity, we restrict to fully connected rectifier (ReLU) nets. The results also apply to convolutions, max-pooling, dropout, dropconnect, maxout, PReLUs and CReLUs (Srivastava et al., 2014; Wan et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2013; He et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2016).",

For hidden layers l 1, . . . , L 1, set al = Wl xl1 and xl = s(al) where s() is applied coordinatewise. The last layer outputs xL = aL = WL xL1. Let pl denote the size of the lth layer; p0 is the size of the input and pL is the size of the output. Suppose the loss `(f , y) is smooth and convex in the first argument. The training data is (xd, yd)Dd=1. The network is trained on stochastic samples from the training data on a series of rounds n = 1, . . . , N . For simplicity we assume minibatch size 1; the results generalize without difficulty. We recall backprop using notation from Martens et al. (2012). Let Jab denote the Jacobian matrix of the vector a with respect to the vector b. By the chain rule the gradient decomposes as Wl ` ( fW(x0), y) = J E L JLL1 Jl+1l} {{ } l xl1 = JEL}{{} f `(f ,y) JLl xl1} {{ } Wl fW(x0)=:Gl (2) where l = JEl is the backpropagated error computed recursively via l = l+1 J l+1 l . 2 The middle expression in (2) is the standard representation of backpropagated gradients. The expression on the right factorizes the backpropagated error l = JEL JLl into the gradient of the loss JEL and the Jacobian JLl between layers, which describes gradient flow within the network. The first-order Taylor approximation to a differentiable function f : R R near a is Ta(x) = f(a) +f (a) (xa). The neural Taylor approximation for a fully connected network is as follows. Definition 1. The Jacobian tensor of layer l, Gl := JLl xl1, is the gradient of the output of the neural network with respect to the weights of layer l. It is the outer product of a (pL pl)-matrix with a pl1-vector, and so is a (pL, pl, pl1)-tensor. Given Gl and (pl pl1)-matrix V, the expression Gl,V := JLl V xl1 is the pL-vector computed via matrix-matrix-vector multiplication. The neural Taylor approximation to f in a neighborhood of Wn, given input xn0 , is the first-order Taylor expansion Tn(V) := fWn(x n 0 ) + L l=1 Gl,Vl Wnl fV(xn0 ). Finally, the Taylor loss of the network on round n is T n(V) = `(Tn(V), yn). 2Note: we suppress the dependence of the Jacobians on the round n to simplify notation. The Taylor approximation to layer l is Tnl (Vl) := fWn(xn0 ) + Gl,Vl Wnl . We can also construct the Taylor approximation to neuron in layer l. Let the pL-vector JL := J L l [ :, ] denote the Jacobian with respect to neuron and let the (pL pl1)-matrix G := JL xl1 denote the Jacobian with respect to the weights of neuron . The Taylor approximation to neuron is Tn(V) := fWn(x n 0 ) + G,V Wn . The Taylor losses are the simplest non-trivial (i.e. non-affine) convex functions encoding the information generated by backprop, see section A.4. The following theorem provides convergence guarantees at mutiple spatial scales: network-wise, layer-wise and neuronal. See sections A.2 for a proof of the theorem. It is not currently clear which scale provides the tightest bound. Theorem 2 (no-regret relative to Taylor optimum). Suppose, as in Theorem 1, the Taylor losses have bounded gradients and the weights of the neural network have bounded diameter during training. Suppose the neural net is optimized by an algorithm with Regret(N) O( N) such as gradient descent, AdaGrad, Adam or mirror descent. Network guarantee: The running average of the training error of the neural network satisfies 1 N N n=1 ` (fWn(x n 0 ), y n)} {{ } running average of training errors min V 1 N N n=1 T n(V) } {{ } Taylor optimum + O ( 1 N ) } {{ } Regret(N)/N .

(4) The global optima of neural nets are not computationally accessible. Theorem 2 sidesteps the problem by providing a guarantee relative to the Taylor optimum. The bound is path-dependent; it depends on the convex snapshots encountered during backprop. In particular, the theorem does not preclude convergence to poor local optima. If the optimizer encounters Taylor losses with poor solutions then the bound remains high even as regret tends to zero.",

Dense layers with architecture 784 50 30 20 30 50 784 and ReLU non-linearities. Trained with MSE loss using minibatches of 64. Convnet trained on CIFAR-10. Three convolutional layers with stack size 64 and 5 5 receptive fields, ReLU non-linearities and 2 2 max-pooling. Followed by a 192 unit fully-connected layer with ReLU before a ten-dimensional fully-connected output layer. Trained with cross-entropy loss using minibatches of 128. For both tasks we compare the optimization performance of Adam, RMSProp and SGD (figure 6). Learning rates were tuned for optimal performance. Additional parameters for Adam and RMSProp were left at default. For the convnet all three methods perform equally well: achieving a small loss and an accuracy of 99% on the training set. However, SGD exhibits slightly more variance. For the autoencoder, although it is an extremely simple model, SGD with the best (fixed) learning rate performs significantly worse than the adaptive optimizers. The neuronal and layer-wise regret are evaluated for each model. At every iteration we record the training error the left-hand-side of eq. (4). To evaluate the Taylor loss, we record the input to the neuron/layer, its weights, the output of the network and the gradient tensor Gl. After training, we minimize the Taylor loss with respect to V to find the Taylor optimum at each round. The regret is the difference between the observed training loss and the optimal Taylor loss. The figures show cumulative losses and regret. For illustrative purposes we normalize by 1/ N : quantities growing at N therefore flatten out. Figure 3(a) compares the average regret incurred by neurons in each convolutional layer of the convnet. Shaded regions show one standard deviation. Dashed lines are the regret of individual neurons importantly the regret behaviour of neurons holds both on average and individually. Figs 3(b) and 3(c) show the regret, cumulative loss incurred by the network, the average loss incurred and the Taylor optimal loss for neurons in layers 1 and 2 respectively. Fig. 4 compares Adam, RMSProp and SGD. Figure 4(a) shows the layer-wise regret on the convnet. The regret of all of the optimizers scales as N for both models, matching the bound in Theorem 2. The additional variance exhibited by SGD explains the difference in regret magnitude. Similar behaviour was observed in the other layers of the networks and also for convnets trained on MNIST. Figure 4(b) shows the same plot for the autoencoder. The regret of all methods scales as N (this also holds for the other layers in the network). The gap in performance can be further explained by examining the difference between the observed loss and Taylor optimal loss. Figure 4(c) compares these quantities for each method on the autoencoder. The adaptive optimizers incur lower losses than SGD. Further, the gap between the actually incurred and optimal loss is smaller for adaptive optimizers. This is possibly because adaptive optimizers find better activation configurations of the network, see discussion in section 3. Remarkably, figures 3 and 4 confirm that regret scales as N for a variety of optimizers, datasets, models, neurons and layers verifying the multi-scale guarantee of Theorem 2. A possible explanation for why optimizers match the worst-case (1/ N ) regret is that the adversary (that is, the landscape) keeps revealing Taylor losses with better solutions. The optimizer struggles to keep up with the hindsight optimum on the constantly changing Taylor losses.",

Two recent papers have shown that noise improves the local optima found during training: Neelakantan et al. (2016) introduce noise into gradients whereas Gulcehre et al. (2016) use noisy activations to extract gradient information from across kinks. Intuitively, noise is a mechanism to peer around kinks in shattered landscapes. Introducing noise is not the only way to find better optima. Not only do adaptive optimizers often converge faster than vanilla gradient descent, they often also converge to better local minima. This section investigates how adaptive optimizers explore shattered landscapes. Section 3.1 shows that smooth regions in rectifier nets correspond to configurations of active neurons and that neural Taylor approximations clamp the configuration of active neurons i.e. the convex flashlight shines on smooth regions in the landscape.

The set of activation configurations encountered by a network over N rounds of training is represented by an (N,D,M) binary tensor denoted A where An := A[n, :, :] := A(Wn). Figure 5 quantifies exploration in the space of activation configurations in three ways: 5(a): Hamming distance plots mink<n An Ak2F , the minimum Hamming distance between the current activation configuration and all previous configurations.

The key analytical tool is the neural Taylor approximation, the first-order approximation to the output of a neural net. The Taylor loss the loss on the neural Taylor approximation is a convex approximation to the loss of the network. Remarkably, the convergence rate matches known lower bounds on convex nonsmooth functions (Bubeck, 2015). Experiments in section 2.3 show the regret matches the theoretical analysis under a wide range of settings. The bound in theorem 2 contains an easy term to optimize (the regret) and a hard term (finding good Taylor losses). Section 3.1 observes that the Taylor losses speak directly to the fundamental difficulty of optimizing nonsmooth functions: that gradients are shattered the gradient at a point is not a reliable estimate of nearby gradients. Smooth regions of rectifier nets correspond to activation configurations. Gradients in one smooth region cannot be used to estimate gradients in another. Exploring the set of activation configurations may therefore be crucial for optimizers to find better local minima in shattered landscapes. Empirical results in section 3.3 suggest that the improved performance of RMSProp over SGD can be explained in part by a carefully tuned exploration bias. Finally, the paper raises several questions: 1. To what extent is exploration necessary for good performance? 2. Can exploration/exploitation tradeoffs in nonsmooth neural nets be quantified? 3. There are exponentially more kinks in early layers (near the input) compared to later layers. Should optimizers explore more aggressively in early layers? 4. Can exploring activation configurations help design better optimizers? The Taylor decomposition provides a useful tool for separating the convex and nonconvex aspects of neural optimization, and may also prove useful when tackling exploration in neural nets.

Recall that the Taylor approximation to layer l is Tnl (Vl) := fWn(x n 0 ) + Gl,Vl Wnl = fWn(x n 0 ) + J L l (Vl Wnl ) xnl1 = fWn(x n 0 ) + ( l+1 k=L Jkk1 ) (Vl Wnl ) xnl1 The Jacobian of layer k is the function Jk+1k (ak) = Wk+1 diag ( s(ak) ) which in general varies nonlinearly with ak. The Taylor approximation clamps the Jacobian by setting it as constant. For a layer of rectifiers, s() = (), the Jacobian Jk+1k = Wk+1 diag ( (ak) ) is constructed by zeroing out the rows of Wk+1 corresponding to inactive neurons in layer k. It follows that the Taylor loss can be written as Tnl (Vl) = ( l+1 k=L Wnk diag(1k1) ) (Vl Wnl ) xnl1 Finally, observe that xnl1 = ( 1 k=l1 diag(1k) Wnk ) xn0 since diag(1k) Wnk xnk1 = diag ( (ak) ) Wnkxnk1 = (Wnk xnk1).",

The constant term is the loss incurred on round n; the linear coefficients are the backpropagated errors. It is easy to see that the two expressions have the same gradient. Why not work directly with the Taylor approximation to the loss? The problem is that the Taylor approximation to the loss is affine, and so decreases without bound. Upgrading to a second order Taylor approximation is no help since it is not convex.",

The hyperparameters used for different optimizers are as follows: the autoencoder uses learning rate = 0.001 for RMSprop and = 0.01 for Adam, while the convnet uses learning rate = 0.0005 for RMSprop and = 0.0002 for Adam. All other hyperparameters are kept at their literature-standard values. Fig. 6 shows the training losses obtained by the convnet on CIFAR-10 and the autoencoder on MNIST. The gradient tensor Gl is not computed explicitly by TensorFlow. Instead, it is necessary to compute the gradient of each component of the output layer (e.g. 10 in total for a network trained on CIFAR10, 784 for an autoencoder trained on MNIST) with respect to Wl and then assemble the gradients into a tensor. When the loss is the squared error, the Taylor optimal at round n can be computed in closed form. Otherwise we use SGD.",
