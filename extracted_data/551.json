      "text": "1 INTRODUCTION Traditionally, computer scientists solve problems by designing algorithms. Recently, this practice has received competition from machine learning methods that automatically extract solutions from data. One example of this development is the field of computer vision, where the state of the art is based on deep neural networks rather than on human-designed algorithms (He et al., 2015). But these two approaches to problem solvingalgorithms and learningare not mutually exclusive; in fact, they can complement each other. Effective problem solving exploits all available information, whether it be encoded in algorithms or captured by data. This paper presents a step towards tightly combining these sources of information. We demonstrate the combination of problem-specific algorithms with generic machine learning in the context of state estimation in robotics. The state estimation problem exhibits a clear algorithmic structure, captured in a provably optimal way by Bayes filters (Thrun et al., 2005). But the use of such a filter requires the specification of a motion model and a measurement model that is specific to a particular problem instance. We want to leverage the general knowledge captured in the Bayes filter, while extracting the instance-specific models from data using deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016). We achieve this by implementing a differentiable version of the histogram filtera specific type of Bayes filter that represents probability distributions with histogramsincluding learnable motion and measurement models (see Fig. 1). With this implementation, we can learn these models end-to-end using backpropagation, while still taking advantage of the structure encoded in Bayes filters. Interestingly, this combination also enables unsupervised learning. Our contributions are both conceptual and technical. Our conceptual contribution is the principle of tightly combining algorithms and machine learning to balance data-efficiency and generality. Our technical contribution is the end-to-end learnable histogram filter, which enables the use of this Bayes filter variant in a more generic way. Our experiments show that our method is more data-efficient than generic neural networks, improves performance compared to standard histogram filters, andmost importantlyenables unsupervised learning of recursive state estimation loops.",

      "text": "Every information that is contained in the solution to a problem must either be provided as prior knowledge (prior for short) or learned from data. Different approaches balance these sources of information differently. In the classic approach to computer science, all required information is provided by a human (e.g. in the form of algorithms and models). In the machine learning approach, only a minimal amount of prior knowledge is provided (in form of a learning algorithm) while most information is extracted from data (see Fig. 2). When trading-off how much and which information should be provided as a prior or emerge from data, we should consider the entire spectrum rather than limit ourselves to these two end points. In the context of robotics, for example, it is clear that the left end of this spectrum will not enable intelligent robots, because we cannot foresee and specify every detail for solving a wide range of tasks in initially unknown environments. Robots need to collect data and learn from them. But if we go all the way to the right end of the spectrum, we need large amounts of data, which is very difficult to obtain in robotics where data collection is slow and costly. Luckily, robotic tasks include rich structure that can be used as prior. Physics, for example, governs the interaction of any robot and its environment and physics-based priors can substantially improve learning (Scholz et al., 2014; Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015). But robotic tasks include additional structure that can be exploited. Every algorithm that has proven successful in robotics implicitly encodes information about the structure of robotic tasks. We propose to use this robotics-specific information captured by robotic algorithms and combine it with machine learning to fill in the task-specific details based on data. By tightly combining algorithms and machine learning, we can strike the right balance between generality and data-efficiency.",

      "text": "Algorithms and machine learning can be combined in different ways, using algorithms either 1) as fixed parts of solutions, 2) as parts of the learning process, or 3) as both. The first approach learns task-specific models in isolation and then combines them with algorithms in the solution. Examples for this approach are numerous, e.g. a Go player that applies a planning algorithm on learned models (Silver et al., 2016), a perception pipeline that combines the iterative closest point algorithm with learned object segmentation (Zeng et al., 2016), or robot control based on learned motion models (Nguyen-Tuong & Peters, 2011). The second approach uses algorithms as teachers to generate training data. With this data, we can learn a function that generalizes beyond the capabilities of the original algorithm or that can be finetuned to a specific problem instance. For example, self-play in Go (using the algorithm as part of the solution) can be used to create new samples to learn from (Silver et al., 2016), training data for learning segmentation can be generated by simple algorithms such as background subtraction (Zeng et al., 2016), and reinforcement learning problems can be solved using training samples generated via trajectory optimization (Levine & Koltun, 2013). The third approachthe one that we are focusing on in this paperuses the same algorithms in the learning process and in the solution. The main idea is to optimize the models for the algorithms that use them rather than learning them in isolation. To achieve this, the algorithms need to be differentiable, such that we can compute how changes in the model affect the output of the algorithm, which allows to train the models end-to-end. This idea has been applied to different algorithms, e.g. in the form of neural Turing machines (Graves et al., 2014) and neural programmer-interpreters (Reed & de Freitas, 2015). In the context of robotics, Tamar et al. (2016) have presented a differentiable planning algorithm based on value iteration. And, most directly related to our work, Haarnoja et al. (2016) have applied this idea to Kalman filters, showing that measurement models based on visual input can be learned end-to-end as part of the filter. Our work differs from this by representing the belief with a histogram rather than a Gaussian, which allows to track multiple hypothesesa neces- sity for many robotic tasks. Furthermore, we focus on tasks where the robot has information about its actions and learn both the measurement model and the motion model jointly. Our paper extends an earlier workshop submission (Jonschkowski & Brock, 2016).",

      "heading": "4 PRELIMINARIES: HISTOGRAM FILTERS AND OTHER BAYES FILTERS",
      "text": "A Bayes filter (Thrun et al., 2005) is an algorithm to recursively estimate a probability distribution over a latent state s (e.g. robot pose) conditioned on the history of observations o (e.g. camera images) and actions a (e.g. velocity commands). This posterior over states is also called belief, Bel(st) = p(st|a1:t1, o1:t). A histogram filter is a type of Bayes filter that represents the belief as a histogram; a discretization of the state space with one probability value per discrete state s. One of the key assumptions in Bayes filters is the Markov property of states, from which follows that the current belief Bel(st) summarizes all information of the entire history of observations and actions that is relevant for predicting the future. Other key assumptions determine how the belief is recursively updated using two alternating steps: the prediction step based on the last action at1 and the measurement update step based on the current measurement ot. Note that these two sources of information are separated, which results from the assumption of conditional independence of observation and action given the state. The prediction step assumes actions to change the state according to the known motion model p(st | st1, at1). After performing an action at1, the new belief for a given state st is computed by summing over all possible ways through which state st could have come about, Bel(st) = st1 p(st | st1, at1)Bel(st1). (1) The measurement update step assumes observations to only depend on the current state as defined by a known measurement model p(ot | st). After receiving an observation ot, the belief for every state st is updated using Bayes rule, Bel(st) p(ot | st)Bel(st). (2) If motion model and measurement model are unknown, we want the robot to learn these models from data. Apart from the assumptions already mentioned, learning explicit models allow us to restrict their hypothesis space according to assumptions (e.g. linear motion). Our goal is to train these models end-to-end such that we find the models that optimize state estimation performance, while preserving the useful assumptions of Bayes filters. Towards this end, we formulate the belief, the prediction, the measurement update, and the corresponding models in the deep learning framework.",

In either way, we might want to optimize the models using gradient descent, for example by computing the gradient of the learning objective with respect to the model parameters using backpropagation (repeated application of the chain rule). Therefore, the motion model and the measurement model need to be differentiable regardless of whether we choose option a) or option b). For b) endto-end learning, we need to backpropagate the gradient through the histogram filter algorithm (not to change the algorithm but to compute how to change the models to improve the algorithms output). Therefore, in addition to the models, the algorithm itself needs to be differentiable. The remainder of this section describes how histogram filters can be implemented in a differentiable way and how they can be learned in isolation or end-to-end. To comply with the deep learning framework, we will define the E2E-HF using vector and matrix operations. We will also introduce additional priors for computational or data efficiency. For the sake of readability, we assume a one-dimensional state space here. All formulas can easily be adapted to higher dimensions. 5.2 BELIEF The histogram over states is implemented as a vector b of probabilities with one entry per bin, bt = [Bel(St = 1), Bel(St = 2), . . . , Bel(St = |S|)]. We can also think of the belief as a neural network layer where the activation of each unit represents the value of a histogram bin. The belief bt constitutes the output of the histogram filter at the current step t and an input at the next step t+ 1together with an action at and an observation ot+1 (see Fig. 3).",

The equation can be vectorized for computational efficiency by defining a |S| |S| matrix F with Fi,j(a) = f(i, j, a), such that bt = F (at1)bt1. However, this approach is computationally expensive because it requires |S|2 evaluations of f for a single prediction step. We can make this computation more efficient, if we assume robot motion to be local and consistent across the state space, i.e. p(st | st1, at1) = p(st | at1), t|st| k, where st = stst1 and k is the maximum state change. Accordingly, we define a new learnable function for the motion model, g : st, at1 7 p(st | at1) and use g instead of f . For vectorization, we define a (2k+1)-dimensional vector g(a), whose elements gi(a) = g(ik1, a) represent the probabilities of all positive and negative state changes up to k. We can now reformulate the prediction step (Eq. 1) as a convolution (), bt = bt1 g(at1), where the belief bt1 is convolved with the motion kernel g(at1) for action at1 (see Fig. 3).",

Another useful prior for g is smoothness with respect to s and a, i.e. that similar combinations of s and a lead to similar probabilities. This smoothness is the reason why (for standard feedforward networks), we should use s as an input rather than as index for different output dimensions. With additional knowledge about robot motion, we can replace smoothnes by a stronger prior. For the experiments in this paper, we assumed linear motion with zero mean Gaussian noise, and therefore defined the motion model with only two learnable parameters and , g(s, a) = e (sa)2 2 , and the obligatory normalization, g(s, a) = g(s,a)k j=k g(j,a) .",

In our experiments, the robot does not know the environment beforehand and thus has to learn state estimation from data. We performed experiments in two localization tasks: a) a hallway localization task (Thrun et al., 2005) and b) a drone localization task (see Fig. 4). The tasks are similar in that they have continuous actions and binary observations (door/wall and purple/white tile), both of which are subject to 10% random error. The tasks differ in their dimensionality. In the hallway task, the robot only needs to estimate a one-dimensional state (its position along the hallway), which for all methods is discretized into 100 states. The drone localization task has a two-dimensional state, which is discretized into 50 bins per dimension resulting in 2500 bins in total. The challenge in both tasks is that the door/tile locations, the scale of the actions, and the amount of random noise are unknown and need to be learned from data, i.e. a sequence of observations, actions, andin the supervised settingstates produced by the robot moving randomly through the environment.

HFs are even more data-efficient but quickly stop improving with additional data. Drone task: For the drone localization task, we performed an experiment using 4000 training steps (see Table 1). Our results show that this data is sufficient for the E2E-HF (but not for the LSTM) to achieve good performance. Our method only required a similar amount of data as for the 1D hallway task, even though the histogram size had increased from 100 to 2500 bins. Discussion: The priors encoded in the E2E-HF improve data efficiency because any information contained in these priors does not need to be extracted from data. This leads to better generalization, e.g. the ability to robustly and accurately track multiple hypotheses (see Fig.6). Note on computational limits: The size of the histogram is exponential in the number of state dimensions. A comparison between the 1D and the 2D task suggests that data might not be the bottleneck for applying the method to higher dimensional problems, since the data requirements were similar. However, the increased histogram size directly translates into longer training times, such that computation quickly becomes the bottleneck for scaling this method to higher-dimensional problems.

At the beginning of every experiment trial, 5 doors are randomly arranged in the 10 spots in the hallway. The binary observation of the robot senses whether the center of the robot is next to a door or next to a wall. With probability 0.1, the observation returns the wrong information, e.g. wall instead of door if the robot is next to a door. The robot is represented as a single point. It moves with a velocity between -1 and 1 meter per time step and stops when it reaches either end of the hallway. The action information that the robot receives is the step that it performed as measured by odometry. This odometry measurement is corrupted with zero mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 10% of its actual movement. Additionally, the odometry is scaled by a number between 0.5 and 5.0, which is randomly sampled at the beginning of every trial, i.e. the robot does not know its exact embodiment. This makes the exact motion model unknown, such that the robot needs to learn it from data. Both during training and during testing the robot moves randomly, i.e. it randomly accelerates by a value between -0.5 and 0.5 at each time step. Apart from this acceleration, its velocity is affected by 10% friction at each time step and is set to zero when the robot reaches either end of the hallway. For each trial, the training data consists of a single random walk of the robot of length between 500 steps and 8000 steps. The data for the unsupervised learning, includes only the sequence of noisy observations and actions. For supervised learning, it additionally includes the groundtruth continuous and discrete state, i.e. the position of the robot. The test data consisted of 1000 short time sequences of the robot moving in the same fashion starting from a random position. For all performance metrics, the belief was tracked for 32 steps. For the metric that measured observation prediction accuracy, the task was to predict 32 future observations given a sequence of 32 actions based on the current belief. A.2 DRONE LOCALIZATION TASK The area for the drone localization task has a size of 5 times 5 meters, where every one meter tile is either purple or white. At the beginning of every experiment, the color of each tile is decided by a fair coin flip. Analogously to the hallway task, the binary observations inform the robot about the color of the tile which is directly underneath it. With probability of 0.1, this observation returns the wrong color. The drone is represented as a single point in 2D space. It moves with velocities between -0.5 and 0.5 meter per time step and stops when it reaches the boundary of the area. The other aspects of its movement, the noisy odometry, and the movement generation for training and test data are analogous to the hallway localization task. A.3 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS LSTM baseline: The LSTM baseline consists of two LSTM layers with 32 units per layer, followed by a softmax layer. Training procedure: All methods where trained via minibatch stochastic gradient descent with batch size 32 using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with learning rate 0.001. The training length was determined using early stopping with patience, where 20% of the training data was used for validation. After 100 epochs without an improvement on the validation data, the parameters that achieved highest validation performance were returned. A.4 SOFTWARE We used v-rep for simulation (E. Rohmer, 2013) and theano (Theano Development Team, 2016) with Lasagne (Dieleman et al., 2015) as deep learning framework for our implementation.",
