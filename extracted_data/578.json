  "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn highly discriminative representations from data, but how robust and structured are these representations? How does the data shape the internal network representation? We shed light on these questions by empirically measuring the invariance and equivariance properties of a large number of CNNs trained with various types of input transformations. We find that CNNs learn invariance wrt all 9 tested transformation types and that invariance extends to transformations outside the training range. We also measure the distance between CNN representations and show that similar input transformations lead to more similar internal representations. Transforms can be grouped by the way they affect the learned representation. Additionally, we also propose a loss function that aims to improve CNN equivariance.",

      "text": "The overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is generally attributed to their ability to learn task-specific representations from large quantities of data. This has led to many state of the art results in areas such as image classification (He et al., 2015), semantic segmentation (Liu et al., 2015), and game-playing Go agents (Silver et al., 2016). However, our current understanding of CNN representations is limited, though there is a growing body of literature on visualization techniques for interpreting internal representations (Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2016; Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016). In this work, we aim to understand the effect that the training data has on three key properties of representations: invariance, equivariance, and equivalence (Lenc & Vedaldi, 2015). Invariance, with respect to a particular transformation (e.g. rotation by = 5), is achieved when the feature vectors for input images at a particular layer do not change when the inputs are transformed. This can be seen as a measure of the robustness of the representation. Equivariance is a generalization of invariance and allows the representation to change in predictable ways in response to input transformations. Equivariance is a rough measure of the structure of the representation space because we can reason about input space transformations in the more abstract representation space. Likewise, measuring equivalence among network representations trained on either the same or different data distributions gives insight into how the training data shapes the representation. Data augmentation has been considered essential for top CNN performance since the seminal work of Krizhevsky et al. (2012). When input images are stochastically perturbed, less overfitting is observed because all inputs are unique. Since then, others have experimented with various data augmentation strategies with great success (Howard, 2013; Wu et al., 2015; He et al., 2014). While others have noted that data augmentation leads to greater representation invariance (Lenc & Vedaldi, 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2014), we measure the amount of invariance achieved in response to 9 types of transforms at various magnitudes. We additionally measure the equivariance and pairwise representation distance of the resulting CNNs. In this work we quantify the invariance and equivariance properties of 70 CNNs on two datasets trained using different input transformations. We find the representation at the penultimate layer (fc7) is structured wrt almost all input transformations when no augmentation is used. Applying data augmentation effectively collapses the structure of the representation space, leading to input transformation invariance for all 9 transforms, including magnitudes of transforms that were not observed during training. We measure the pairwise distances of the CNN representations by measuring the error of learned mappings between CNN representations. There is a strong bias towards similarity among CNNs trained with the same type of transformation, and we can group transformations based on their mutual average distances. Similar types of transformations (e.g. Color Jitter, Gaussian Noise) yield more similar representations compared to other dissimilar transform pairs. We also propose a way to increase the equivariance of a CNN by finetuning on a novel loss function that simultaneously minimizes classification error for both transformed and untransformed inputs. This leads to an increase in equivariance while improving or slightly decreasing performance on the untransformed images (dataset dependent), though this trade-off can be controlled by weighting the terms of the loss function.",

      "text": "Lenc & Vedaldi (2015) studied image representations and gave definitions for representation invariance, equivariance, and equivalence. They measured these properties wrt a limited number of transforms for the convolutional layers of the popular AlexNet architecture. We provide extensions to the definitions of these properties to measure the relative degree to which representations possess these properties. We also consider a wider variety of transformations and use the fc7 layer of AlexNet because it is the most invariant layer. Convergent learning is the idea that identical networks (differing in random initialization) converge to the same representation (i.e.. representation equivalence). In Li et al. (2015), the authors show that there are many corresponding convolutional filters among CNNs for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. In complementary fashion, we measure representation distances between last fully connected layers in CNNs trained over different transformations of their inputs. In Krizhevsky et al. (2012), applying random crops, horizontal flips and color jittering during training reduced the top-1 error by over 1%. Howard (2013) applied additional brightness, contrast, crop, and scale transformations at both training and test time to reduce validation top-1 error from 40.7% to 37.0%. Wu et al. (2015) adds rotation and photo filter effects such as lens distortion, vignetting, and color casting for further improvement. Similarly, we explore a series of 10 types of transformations applied at training time; however, we focus on how they affect the learned representation instead of optimizing classifier performance. In Peng et al. (2014), synthetic images rendered from 3D CAD models are used to explore invariance in object detection networks for factors such as pose, object texture, and foreground/background color. Training a CNN on images that vary in these aspect results in greater invariance than training with less data variety. 3D CAD models are also used in Aubry & Russell (2015) to show that upper layers of CNNs disentangle and (locally) linearize independent object factors such as object viewpoint, style, color, and scale. ManiTest (Fawzi & Frossard, 2015) defines classifier invariance as the average magnitude of the minimal transform that causes predictions to change. In contrast, we examine internal CNN representations and measure both representation distance and classifier performance.",

We will use X to denote the input space and Z the output space (i.e. : X Z). may be equivariant to some transformations, but not others, so we say that is equivariant wrt g : X X iff Mg : Z Z, x X : (gx) Mg(x) (1) This means that transformation by g in X corresponds to a transformation by Mg (if it exists) in Z. Thus if Mg exists, it informs us of the structure of the abstract space Z in terms of the concrete space X . If Mg is the identity transform, then maps x and gx to the same point in Z, which leads to invariance wrt g (i.e. (gx) (x)). This is related to the idea of whether CNNs collapse (invariance) or linearize (equivariance) view manifolds of 3D objects (Bakry et al., 2015; Aubry & Russell, 2015). While the previous definitions suggest equivariance and invariance are all-or-nothing properties, we use the following definition to precisely define the used in Eq 1. We measure the equivariance of wrt a transform g as Equivaraince(g;L) = min Mg 1 N N i=1 L((xi),Mg(gxi)) (2) whereL is a suitable loss function such as classification error or L2 distance (Section 3.3). Invariance is similarly measured by fixing Mg as the identity function. In practice, it is difficult to maximize Mg over the space of all functions, so we restrict Mg to be a simple parametric function (e.g. linear) and learn the parameters from data. Thus our results can be considered a lower bound on the actual equivariance of the representation. Eq. 2 also uses the paradigm that Mg attempts to undo in Z the transformation g performed in X . This is also done in Lenc & Vedaldi (2015) and allows us to compute classification based metrics by applying the same classifier to both (x) and Mg(gx).",

If E1 is invertible, then E11 satisfies 1(x) E 1 1 2(x). In the other direction, if the relation is symmetric, then E2 such that 1(x) E22(x) and such an E2 is an inverse of E1. In light of this, we propose renaming Eq 3 to be the sub-representation property with the the terminology that 2 is a sub-representation of 1. We then define 1 and 2 to be equivalent iff an invertible E1 exists. One example of sub-representation are two reprensetations characterized by (1) the RGB pixels of an image and (2) the corresponding grayscale intensities. The grayscale is a sub-representation of the RGB because we can recover the grayscale from the RGB, but not vice versa. As with equivariance, we are interested in measuring the extent that two representations are distinct. Thus we define the distance between two representations as D(1, 2) = min E1 [L(E11(x), 2)] + min E2 [L(1, E22(x))] (4) As with Mg , finding the optimal E1, E2 is difficult, so we learn linear models from data.

CNNs for classification tasks are typically trained with a cross entropy loss, i.e. Ld(X,Y ) = 1 N N i=1 H(yi, C((xi))) (5) where X is the training images, Y is the training labels, and H computes cross entropy. Ld can be augmented by a term that biases the representation to be equivariant to some set of transforms G = g1, g2, ..., gJ. We propose the loss function, Le, which is minimized when the transformed images are both correctly classified and spatially close to the untransformed image inZ. Le(X,Y ) = 1 NJ N i=1 J j=1 [ H(yi, C(x ij)) + 1||xij (xi)||22 + 2||(gjxi) (xi)||22 ] (6) where xij = Mgj(gjxi). The first term of the sum is the classification loss of the transformed images, while the second and third terms respectively enforce equivariance and invariance. In our experiments, we set 1 = 504096 , 2 = 25 4096 , though the results do not appear highly sensitive to this particular setting. Each equivariance mapping Mgj constitutes a new portion of the network that attempts to undo the transformation gj in the Z. As such, the parameters of Mgj must be learned along with the parameters of the network. Combining Eq. 5 and 6, we arrive at our combined loss: L(X,Y ) = Ld(X,Y ) + 3Le(X,Y ) (7) We found that 3 = 0.3 provides good compromise between performance on the transformed and untransformed data, though 3 can be tuned for individual performance requirements.",

For example, the 4 CNNs trained on different ranges of rotations ( [5, 5], [10, 10], [15, 15], [20, 20]) all have their equivariance measured wrt rotations of = 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40.

We aim to compare and contrast the invariance and equivariance of the various transforms for these two datasets. In our experiments CNNs are trained using the training splits, using the validation split for model selection. For learning equivariance mappings and representation distance mappings, we use a static randomly chosen 50K training images for ILSVRC and the validation split for RVL-CDIP. Thus the reported metrics are over the validation split for ILSVRC and test split for RVL-CDIP.

For each transform type, we compare the CNN trained with the most extreme transforms to the baseline model trained with no data augmentation. The transformations we measured range from no transform to approximately double the transformation magnitude seen during training. In many instances (e.g. Blur, Noise), the baseline models performance deteriorates rapidly even for mild transformations. The large difference between the baseline invariance (black line) and equivariance (red line) indicate that Z is structured wrt most transforms (Color is one exception). For CNNs trained with data augmentation, the equivariance mapping does not improve performance for transforms that are observed during training. This suggests that Z may not be (linearly) struc- tured wrt those particular transforms possibly because the structure has been collapsed due to the training object. Some transforms (e.g. Noise, Blur, Shear), at large magnitudes, do show a gap between the equivariance and invariance lines, suggesting that Z is structured wrt these transforms. Equivariance performance does drop off outside the training range, but not near as sharply as the baseline model (e.g Figs. 7a, 7c, 7f), so CNN representations generalize somewhat to unseen transforms.

Using equation 4 (L = LL2), we computed a pairwise distance matrix for the 37 network representations. We attempted a T-SNE embedding (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) visualization, but the distances seem intrinsically difficult to embed in 2D (see Appendix B.3). Comments on the asymmetry of the distances measured can be found in Appendix B.3. There is, however, a strong bias towards networks of the same training transformation to be nearer to each other compared to random chance. We performed a K-NN analysis by counting the percentage of same-transform pairs that are K nearest neighbors (Figure 3a). Approximately 80% of sametransform pairs are within 5 neighbors of each other for RVL-CDIP (10 neighbors for ILSVRC). This indicates that networks trained with the same transform end up with more similar representations, though the strength of the transformation and network initialization also play a role. We also visualize the average distance between CNNs grouped by transformation type (Figs 3c and 3b). Patterns emerge in both datasets. In RVL-CDIP, Crop is the most unique transform because the CNNs learn features as a different static image scale. On the other hand, Crop is not as unique for ILSVRC because objects appear at multiple sizes, so the features learned are not targeted at a single size. Blur, especially for ILSVRC, seems to give unique representations because it changes the local textures from which the representation is derived in a bottom-up fashion. Refining the representation in a top-down manner may be a further avenue for improving CNN representation robustness. Rotation, Shear, and Perspective transforms are mutually similar for both datasets. This is likely because all three move local pixels in a rigid fashion. Another mutually similar group is Baseline, Color Jitter, and Gaussian Noise, which all operate on pixels independently.

One way to parameterize (8 parameters) a perspective transform is to specify the output coordinates of the input unit square, so that the unit square is mapped to an arbitrary quadrilateral. When training a CNN, for each image we first sampled from a uniform distribution. Then we sampled the displacement of the coordinates of the unit square from a Gaussian Distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation . Thus the output coordinates for the upper left corner of the unit square are x = N(0, ), y = N(0, ). For the lower right corner, they would be x = 1 + N(0, ), y = 1 + N(0, ). Then the image is warped according to the perspective transform defined by the output coordinates of the unit square. The ranges used for training are sigma = [0, 0.001], [0, 0.002], [0, 0.003], [0, .004].

      "text": "B.1 INVARIANCE AND EQUIVARIANCE In this section, we include additional results from the experiments in Section 6.1 that did not fit in the main text. Figure 1 presents invariance and equivariance measurements for the ILSVRC dataset (similar to Figure 7). We observe several interesting differences to the results on RVL-CDIP. The baseline model for ILSVRC is significantly more invariant to vertical mirrors than horizontal mirrors, though the RVLCDIP baseline performs equally bad on both types of mirrors. Brightness increases affect ILSVRC trained CNNs more, though this is likely because natural images are more susceptible to image saturation because they occupy the full spectrum of pixel intensities, while document images tend to be bi-modal. The RVL-CDIP CNN trained on Gaussian Noise was able to learn invariance, while the corresponding ILSVRC CNN did not. However, both the baseline and noise CNN for ILSVRC can correct for the noise with an equivariant mapping. Figures 8 and 9 show the invariance/equivariance for all 70 CNNs trained with data augmentation. In general, we see an overwhelming trend that training with greater variety of inputs transforms results in greater invariance and equivariance. The exception seems to be that the magnitude of color jittering does not highly affect the CNN robustness. Early CNN layers can easily become invariant to overall brightness changes by extracting information based on pixel differences, and prior work has shown that later layers encode information mostly by which neurons are non-zero, rather than the magnitude of the neuron activations (Agrawal et al., 2014). For Crop transforms (Figure 8c), we examined 25 evenly spaced crops arranged in a 5x5 grid. The x-axis of the figure shows these crops ordered in scan-line order. The periodic nature of the graph shows that crops nearer the center of the image yield higher performance. There is virtually no difference between the invariance and equivariance measurements for the Crop CNNs, showing that the high level CNN features trained for classification are not predictive for image extrapolation. This is because the equivariance mapping for Crop transforms uses the CNN activations for some un-centered crop to predict the CNN activations over the center crop.",

While all previous experiments measure invariance/equivariance on the same dataset that the CNN was trained on (though with different splits), here we use a new dataset to measure the invariance/equivariance of CNNs trained on RVL-CDIP. The new dataset, ANDOC, is also composed of grayscale document images, though while RVL-CDIP is composed of scanned office documents, ANDOC is composed of digitized historical documents, which differ significantly from modern office documents. As the RVL-CDIP CNNs were not trained to classify ANDOC documents, we resort to measuring the LL2 difference in the feature representations.",

This makes sense because the CNNs learn to encode discriminative information about RVL-CDIP documents. However, the invariance and equivariance properties are not lost when switching to a new domain of data. In fact, for Mirror, Rotation, and Shear transforms, the invariance is higher, though this is likely due to less information about the input image being encoded for the new domain.",

      "text": "In this section, we include additional results from the experiments in Section 6.2 that did not fit in the main text. Figure 11 shows an example T-SNE embedding of the CNN representations. There appears to be very little cluster structure and the T-SNE embeddings appear to be sensitive to the random initialization of the embedding vectors. The results from multiple runs of the T-SNE embedding in general do not agree on either which points are outliers or on nearest neighbor pairs. This is likely because representation distances do not seem to follow the triangle inequality axiom. While Eq. 4 yields a symmetric function by averaging two one-way distances, we find that for some pairs of CNNs, there is significant difference between the magnitudes of those one-way distances. In other words, D(1, 2) = min E1 [L(E11(x), 2)]min E2 [L(1, E22(x))] (9) is large. Figure 12 plots a heat map of Eq. 9 applied pairwise to each CNN for each dataset. Optimization difficulties are one possible cause of large values in Figure 12. However, a more likely explanation is that some CNNs encode unique information about the input that cannot be predicted from the representations learned from other CNNs. B.4 IMPROVED EQUIVARIANCE Table 4 shows the results of finetuning using Eq. 7 for CNNs trained with different types of data augmentation. Overall, finetuning improves 3 of 9 transform types. We believe that performance does not improve for some transforms because the dataset naturally contains examples of those transforms due to different object poses. This is not the case for RVL-CDIP because the document images are always scanned in the same manner.",
