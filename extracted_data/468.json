  "abstract": "Network quantization is one of network compression techniques to reduce the redundancy of deep neural networks. It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper, we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet, 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet, respectively.",

      "text": "Deep neural networks have emerged to be the state-of-the-art in the field of machine learning for image classification, object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation (LeCun et al., 2015). The substantial progress of neural networks however comes with high cost of computations and hardware resources resulting from a large number of parameters. For example, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) came up with a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 61 million parameters and won the ImageNet competition in 2012. It is followed by deeper neural networks with even larger numbers of parameters, e.g., Simonyan & Zisserman (2014). The large sizes of deep neural networks make it difficult to deploy them on resource-limited devices, e.g., mobile or portable devices, and network compression is of great interest in recent years to reduce computational cost and memory requirements for deep neural networks. Our interest in this paper is mainly on curtailing the size of the storage (memory) for network parameters (weights and biases). In particular, we focus on the network size compression by reducing the number of distinct network parameters by quantization. Besides network quantization, network pruning has been studied for network compression to remove redundant parameters permanently from neural networks (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989; LeCun et al., 1989; Hassibi & Stork, 1993; Han et al., 2015b; Lebedev & Lempitsky, 2016; Wen et al., 2016). Matrix/tensor factorization and low-rank approximation have been investigated as well to find more efficient representations of neural networks with a smaller number of parameters and consequently to save computations (Sainath et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2013; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Lebedev et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015; Novikov et al., 2015). Moreover, similar to network quantization, low-precision network implementation has been examined in Vanhoucke et al. (2011); Courbariaux et al. (2014); Anwar et al. (2015); Gupta et al. (2015); Lin et al. (2015a). Some extremes of low-precision neural networks consisting of binary or ternary parameters can be found in Courbariaux et al. (2015); Lin et al. (2015b); Rastegari et al. (2016). We note that these are different types of network compression techniques, which can be employed on top of each other. Themost related work to our investigation in this paper can be found in Gong et al. (2014); Han et al. (2015a), where a conventional quantization method using k-means clustering is employed for network quantization. This conventional approach however is proposed with little consideration for the impact of quantization errors on the neural network performance loss and no effort to optimize the quantization procedure for a given compression ratio constraint. In this paper, we reveal the suboptimality of this conventional method and newly design quantization schemes for neural networks. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the network performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint and find efficient quantization methods for neural networks. The main contribution of the paper can be summarized as follows: It is derived that the performance loss due to quantization in neural networks can be quantified approximately by the Hessian-weighted distortion measure. Then, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for network quantization to minimize the performance loss. It is identified that the optimization problem for network quantization provided a compression ratio constraint can be reduced to an entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem when optimal variable-length binary coding is employed after quantization. Two efficient heuristic solutions for ECSQ are proposed for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyds algorithm. As an alternative of Hessian, it is proposed to utilize some function (e.g., square root) of the second moment estimates of gradients when the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) stochastic gradient decent (SGD) optimizer is used in training. The advantage of using this alternative is that it is computed while training and can be obtained at the end of training at no additional cost. It is shown how the proposed network quantization schemes can be applied for quantizing network parameters of all layers together at once, rather than layer-by-layer network quantization in Gong et al. (2014); Han et al. (2015a). This follows from our investigation that Hessian-weighting can handle the different impact of quantization errors properly not only within layers but also across layers. Moreover, quantizing network parameters of all layers together, one can even avoid layer-by-layer compression rate optimization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the network quantization problem and review the conventional quantization method using k-means clustering. Section 3 discusses Hessian-weighted network quantization. Our entropy-constrained network quantization schemes follow in Section 4. Finally, experiment results and conclusion can be found in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.",

If no network pruning is employed, all parameters in a network are subject to quantization. For pruned networks, our focus is on quantization of unpruned parameters. The goal of network quantization is to quantize (unpruned) network parameters in order to reduce the size of the storage for them while minimizing the performance degradation due to quantization. For network quantization, network parameters are grouped into clusters. Parameters in the same cluster share their quantized value, which is the representative value (i.e., cluster center) of the cluster they belong to. After quantization, lossless binary coding follows to encode quantized parameters into binary codewords to store instead of actual parameter values.

(1) Observe in (1) that the compression ratio depends not only on the number of clusters but also on the sizes of the clusters and the lengths of the binary codewords assigned to them, in particular, when a variable-length code is used for encoding quantized values.

(2) We observe two issues with employing k-means clustering for network quantization. First, although k-means clustering minimizes the MSQE, it does not imply that k-means clustering minimizes the performance loss due to quantization as well in neural networks. K-means clustering treats quantization errors from all network parameters with equal importance. However, quantization errors from some network parameters may degrade the performance more significantly that the others. Thus, for minimizing the loss due to quantization in neural networks, one needs to take this dissimilarity into account. Second, k-means clustering does not consider any compression ratio constraint. It simply minimizes its distortion measure for a given number of clusters, i.e., for k clusters. This is however suboptimal when variable-length coding follows since the compression ratio depends not only on the number of clusters but also on the sizes of the clusters and assigned codeword lengths to them, which are determined by the binary coding scheme employed after clustering. Therefore, for the optimization of network quantization given a compression ratio constraint, one need to take the impact of binary coding into account, i.e., we need to solve the quantization problem under the actual compression ratio constraint imposed by the specific binary coding scheme employed after clustering.",

Assume that the loss function has reached to one of its local minima, at w = w, after training. At local minima, gradients are all zero, i.e., we have g(w) = 0, and thus the first term in the right-hand side of (3) can be neglected at w = w. The third term in the right-hand side of (3) is also ignored under the assumption that the average loss function is approximately quadratic at the local minimum w = w. Finally, for simplicity, we approximate the Hessian matrix as a diagonal matrix by setting its off-diagonal terms to be zero. Then, it follows from (3) that L(X ; w) 1 2 N i=1 hii(w)|wi| 2, (4) where hii(w) is the second-order partial derivative of the average loss function with respect to wi evaluated atw = w, which is the i-th diagonal element of the Hessian matrixH(w). Now, we connect (4) with the problem of network quantization by treating wi as the quantization error of network parameter wi at its local optimum wi = wi, i.e., wi = wi wi, (5) where wi is a quantized value of wi. Finally, combining (4) and (5), we derive that the local impact of quantization on the average loss function at w = w can be quantified approximately as follows: L(X ; w) 1 2 N i=1 hii(w)|wi wi| 2. (6) At a local minimum, the diagonal elements of Hessian, i.e., hii(w)s, are all non-negative and thus the summation in (6) is always additive, implying that the average loss function either increases or stays the same.

Observe in (7) that we give a larger penalty for a network parameter in defining the distortion measure for clustering when its second-order partial derivative is larger, in order to avoid a large deviation from its original value, since the impact on the loss function due to quantization is expected to be larger for that parameter. Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is locally optimal in minimizing the quantization loss when fixed-length binary coding follows, where the compression ratio solely depends on the number of clusters as shown in Section 2.1.

An efficient way of computing the diagonal of Hessian is presented in Le Cun (1987); Becker & Le Cun (1988) and it is based on the back propagation method that is similar to the back propagation algorithm used for computing first-order partial derivatives (gradients). That is, computing the diagonal of Hessian is of the same order of complexity as computing gradients. Hessian computation and our network quantization are performed after completing network training. For the data set X used to compute Hessian in (8), we can either reuse a training data set or use some other data set, e.g., validation data set.

The Adam algorithm computes adaptive learning rates for individual network parameters from the first and second moment estimates of gradients. We compare the Adam method to Newtons optimization method using Hessian and notice that the second moment estimates of gradients in the Adam method act like the Hessian in Newtons method. This observation leads us to use some function (e.g., square root) of the second moment estimates of gradients as an alternative of Hessian. The advantage of using the second moment estimates from the Adam method is that they are computed while training and we can obtain them at the end of training at no additional cost. It makes Hessian-weighting more feasible for deep neural networks, which have millions of parameters. We note that similar quantities can be found and used for other SGD optimization methods using adaptive learning rates, e.g., AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) and RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012).",

Layer-by-layer quantization was examined in the previous work (Gong et al., 2014; Han et al., 2015a). However, e.g., in Han et al. (2015a), a larger number of bits (a larger number of clusters) are assigned to convolutional layers than fully-connected layers, which implies that they heuristically treat convolutional layers more importantly. This follows from the fact that the impact of quantization errors on the performance varies significantly across layers; some layers, e.g., convolutional layers, may be more important than the others. This concern is exactly what we can address by Hessian-weighting. Hessian-weighting properly handles the different impact of quantization errors not only within layers but also across layers and thus it can be employed for quantizing all layers of a network together. The impact of quantization errors may vary more substantially across layers than within layers. Thus, Hessian-weighting may show more benefit in deeper neural networks. We note that Hessianweighting can still provide gain even for layer-by-layer quantization since it can address the different impact of the quantization errors of network parameters within each layer as well. Recent neural networks are getting deeper, e.g., see Szegedy et al. (2015a;b); He et al. (2015). For such deep neural networks, quantizing network parameters of all layers together is even more advantageous since we can avoid layer-by-layer compression rate optimization. Optimizing compression ratios jointly across all individual layers (to maximize the overall compression ratio for a network) requires exponential time complexity with respect to the number of layers.

This optimization problem is too complex to solve for any arbitrary variablelength binary code since the average codeword length b can be arbitrary. However, we identify that it can be simplified if optimal codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are assumed to be used. In particular, optimal coding closely achieves the lower limit of the average source code length, i.e., entropy, and then we approximately have b H = k i=1 pi log2 pi, (10) where H is the entropy of the quantized network parameters after clustering (i.e., source), given that pi = |Ci|/N is the ratio of the number of network parameters in cluster Ci to the number of all network parameters (i.e., source distribution).

      "text": "This paper investigates the quantization problem of network parameters in deep neural networks. We identify the suboptimality of the conventional quantization method using k-means clustering and newly design network quantization schemes so that they can minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. In particular, we analytically show that Hessian can be used as a measure of the importance of network parameters and propose to minimize Hessianweighted quantization errors in average for clustering network parameters to quantize. Hessianweighting is beneficial in quantizing all of the network parameters together at once since it can handle the different impact of quantization errors properly not only within layers but also across layers. Furthermore, we make a connection from the network quantization problem to the entropyconstrained data compression problem in information theory and push the compression ratio to the limit that information theory provides. Two efficient heuristic solutions are presented to this end, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution for ECSQ. Our experiment results show that the proposed network quantization schemes provide considerable gain over the conventional method using k-means clustering, in particular for large and deep neural networks.",

      "text": "A.1 FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE HESSIAN-WEIGHTED QUANTIZATION ERROR The diagonal approximation for Hessian simplifies the optimization problem as well as its solution for network quantization. This simplification comeswith some performance loss. We conjecture that the loss due to this approximation is small. The reason is that the contributions from off-diagonal terms are not always additive and their summationmay end up with a small value. However, diagonal terms are all non-negative and therefore their contributions are always additive. We do not verify this conjecture in this paper since solving the problem without diagonal approximation is too complex; we even need to compute the whole Hessian matrix, which is also too costly. Observe that the relation of the Hessian-weighted distortion measure to the quantization loss holds for any model for which the objective function can be approximated as a quadratic function with respect to the parameters to quantize in the model. Hence, the quantization methods proposed in this paper to minimize the Hessian-weighted distortion measure are not specific to neural networks but are generally applicable to quantization of parameters of any model whose objective function is locally quadratic with respect to its parameters approximately. Finally, we do not consider the interactions between quantization and retraining in our formulation in Section 3.2. We analyze the expected loss due to quantization assuming no further retraining and focus on finding optimal network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss. In our experiments, however, we further fine-tune the quantized values (cluster centers) so that we can recover the loss due to quantization and improve the performance. A.2 EXPERIMENT RESULTS FOR UNIFORM QUANTIZATION We compare uniform quantization with non-weighted mean and uniform quantization with Hessianweighted mean in Figure 3, which shows that uniform quantization with Hessian-weighted mean slightly outperforms uniform quantization with non-weighted mean. A.3 FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ITERATIVE ALGORITHM FOR ECSQ In order to solve the ECSQ problem for network quantization, we define a Lagrangian cost function: J(C1, C2, . . . , Ck) = D + H = 1 N k j=1 wiCj (hii|wi cj | 2 log2 pj) } {{ } =d(i,j) , (12) where D = 1 N k j=1 wiCj hii|wi cj | 2, H = k j=1 pj log2 pj . Algorithm 1 Iterative solution for entropy-constrained network quantization Initialization: n 0 Initialize the centers of k clusters: c (0) 1 , . . . , c (0) k Initialize the proportions of k clusters (set all of them to be the same initially): p (0) 1 , . . . , p (0) k repeat Assignment: for all network parameters i = 1 N do Assign wi to the cluster j that minimizes the individual Lagrangian cost as follows: C (n+1) l C (n+1) l wi for l = argmin j hii|wi c (n) j | 2 log2 p (n) j end for Update: for all clusters j = 1 k do Update the cluster center and the proportion of cluster j: c (n+1) j wiC (n+1) j hiiwi wiC (n+1) j hii and p (n+1) j |C (n+1) j | N end for n n+ 1 until Lagrangian cost function J decreases less than some threshold The entropy-constrained network quantization problem is then reduced to find k partitions (clusters) C1, C2, . . . , Ck that minimize the Lagrangian cost function as follows: argmin C1,C2,...,Ck J(C1, C2, . . . , Ck). A heuristic iterative algorithm to solve this method of Lagrange multipliers for network quantization is presented in Algorithm 1. It is similar to Lloyds algorithm for k-means clustering. The key difference is how to partition network parameters at the assignment step. In Lloyds algorithm, the Euclidean distance (quantization error) is minimized. For ECSQ, the individual Lagrangian cost function, i.e., d(i, j) in (12), is minimized instead, which includes both quantization error and expected codeword length after entropy coding.",
