The learning phase is a datadriven process that shapes the energy surface in such a way that the desired configurations get assigned low energies, while the incorrect ones are given high energies. Supervised learning falls into this framework: for each X in the training set, the energy of the pair (X,Y ) takes low values when Y is the correct label and higher values for incorrect Y s. Similarly, when modeling X alone within an unsupervised learning setting, lower energy is attributed to the data manifold. The term contrastive sample is often used to refer to a data point causing an energy pull-up, such as the incorrect Y s in supervised learning and points from low data density regions in unsupervised learning.",

The basic idea of GAN is to simultaneously train a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator is trained to distinguish real samples of a dataset from fake samples produced by the generator. The generator uses input from an easy-to-sample random source, and is trained to produce fake samples that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real data samples. During training, the generator receives the gradient of the output of the discriminator with respect to the fake sample. In the original formulation of GAN in Goodfellow et al. (2014), the discriminator produces a probability and, under certain conditions, convergence occurs when the distribution produced by the generator matches the data distribution. From a game theory point of view, the convergence of a GAN is reached when the generator and the discriminator reach a Nash equilibrium.",

The energy function computed by the discriminator can be viewed as a trainable cost function for the generator. The discriminator is trained to assign low energy values to the regions of high data density, and higher energy values outside these regions. Conversely, the generator can be viewed as a trainable parameterized function that produces samples in regions of the space to which the discriminator assigns low energy. While it is often possible to convert energies into probabilities through a Gibbs distribution (LeCun et al., 2006), the absence of normalization in this energy-based form of GAN provides greater flexibility in the choice of architecture of the discriminator and the training procedure. The probabilistic binary discriminator in the original formulation of GAN can be seen as one way among many to define the contrast function and loss functional, as described in LeCun et al. (2006) for the supervised and weakly supervised settings, and Ranzato et al. (2007) for unsupervised learning. We experimentally demonstrate this concept, in the setting where the discriminator is an autoencoder architecture, and the energy is the reconstruction error. More details of the interpretation of EBGAN are provided in the appendix B. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: An energy-based formulation for generative adversarial training. A proof that under a simple hinge loss, when the system reaches convergence, the generator of EBGAN produces points that follow the underlying data distribution. An EBGAN framework with the discriminator using an auto-encoder architecture in which the energy is the reconstruction error. A set of systematic experiments to explore hyper-parameters and architectural choices that produce good result for both EBGANs and probabilistic GANs.

      "text": "In this section, we present a theoretical analysis of the system presented in section 2.1. We show that if the system reaches a Nash equilibrium, then the generator G produces samples that are indistinguishable from the distribution of the dataset. This section is done in a non-parametric setting, i.e. we assume that D and G have infinite capacity. Given a generator G, let pG be the density distribution of G(z) where z pz . In other words, pG is the density distribution of the samples generated by G. We define V (G,D) = x,z LD(x, z)pdata(x)pz(z)dxdz and U(G,D) = z LG(z)pz(z)dz. We train the discriminatorD to minimize the quantity V and the generatorG to minimize the quantityU . A Nash equilibrium of the system is a pair (G, D) that satisfies: V (G, D) V (G, D) D (3) U(G, D) U(G,D) G (4) Theorem 1. If (D, G) is a Nash equilibrium of the system, then pG = pdata almost everywhere, and V (D, G) = m. Proof. First we observe that V (G, D) = x pdata(x)D(x)dx+ z pz(z) [mD(G(z))]+ dz (5) = x ( pdata(x)D(x) + pG(x) [mD(x)]+ ) dx. (6) The analysis of the function (y) = ay+b(my)+ (see lemma 1 in appendix A for details) shows: (a) D(x) m almost everywhere. To verify it, let us assume that there exists a set of measure non-zero such that D(x) > m. Let D(x) = min(D(x),m). Then V (G, D) < V (G, D) which violates equation 3. (b) The function reaches its minimum in m if a < b and in 0 otherwise. So V (G, D) reaches its minimum when we replace D(x) by these values. We obtain V (G, D) = m x 1pdata(x)<pG (x)pdata(x)dx+m x 1pdata(x)pG (x)pG(x)dx (7) = m x ( 1pdata(x)<pG (x)pdata(x) + ( 1 1pdata(x)<pG (x) ) pG(x) ) dx (8) = m x pG(x)dx+m x 1pdata(x)<pG (x)(pdata(x) pG(x))dx (9) = m+m x 1pdata(x)<pG (x)(pdata(x) pG(x))dx. (10) The second term in equation 10 is non-positive, so V (G, D) m. By putting the ideal generator that generates pdata into the right side of equation 4, we get x pG(x)D (x)dx x pdata(x)D (x)dx. (11) Thus by (6), x pG(x)D (x)dx+ x pG(x)[mD(x)]+dx V (G, D) (12) and since D(x) m, we get m V (G, D). Thus, m V (G, D) m i.e. V (G, D) = m. Using equation 10, we see that can only happen if x 1pdata(x)<pG(x)dx = 0, which is true if and only if pG = pdata almost everywhere (this is because pdata and pG are probabilities densities, see lemma 2 in the appendix A for details). Theorem 2. A Nash equilibrium of this system exists and is characterized by (a) pG = pdata (almost everywhere) and (b) there exists a constant [0,m] such that D(x) = (almost everywhere).1. 1This is assuming there is no region where pdata(x) = 0. If such a region exists, D(x) may have any value in [0,m] for x in this region. Proof. See appendix A.",

(13) The diagram of the EBGAN model with an auto-encoder discriminator is depicted in figure 1. The choice of the auto-encoders for D may seem arbitrary at the first glance, yet we postulate that it is conceptually more attractive than a binary logistic network: Rather than using a single bit of target information to train the model, the reconstruction-based output offers a diverse targets for the discriminator. With the binary logistic loss, only two targets are possible, so within a minibatch, the gradients corresponding to different samples are most likely far from orthogonal. This leads to inefficient training, and reducing the minibatch sizes is often not an option on current hardware. On the other hand, the reconstruction loss will likely produce very different gradient directions within the minibatch, allowing for larger minibatch size without loss of efficiency. Auto-encoders have traditionally been used to represent energy-based model and arise naturally. When trained with some regularization terms (see section 2.3.1), auto-encoders have the ability to learn an energy manifold without supervision or negative examples. This means that even when an EBGAN auto-encoding model is trained to reconstruct a real sample, the discriminator contributes to discovering the data manifold by itself. To the contrary, without the presence of negative examples from the generator, a discriminator trained with binary logistic loss becomes pointless.",

      "text": "One common issue in training auto-encoders is that the model may learn little more than an identity function, meaning that it attributes zero energy to the whole space. In order to avoid this problem, the model must be pushed to give higher energy to points outside the data manifold. Theoretical and experimental results have addressed this issue by regularizing the latent representations (Vincent et al., 2010; Rifai et al., 2011; MarcAurelio Ranzato & Chopra, 2007; Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010). Such regularizers aim at restricting the reconstructing power of the auto-encoder so that it can only attribute low energy to a smaller portion of the input points. We argue that the energy function (the discriminator) in the EBGAN framework is also seen as being regularized by having a generator producing the contrastive samples, to which the discriminator ought to give high reconstruction energies. We further argue that the EBGAN framework allows more flexibility from this perspective, because: (i)-the regularizer (generator) is fully trainable instead of being handcrafted; (ii)-the adversarial training paradigm enables a direct interaction between the duality of producing contrastive sample and learning the energy function.",

Another technique minibatch discrimination was developed by Salimans et al. (2016) from the same philosophy. Implementing the repelling regularizer involves a Pulling-away Term (PT) that runs at a representation level. Formally, let S RsN denotes a batch of sample representations taken from the encoder output layer. Let us define PT as: fPT (S) = 1 N(N 1) i j 6=i ( STi Sj SiSj )2 . (14) PT operates on a mini-batch and attempts to orthogonalize the pairwise sample representation. It is inspired by the prior work showing the representational power of the encoder in the auto-encoder alike model such as Rasmus et al. (2015) and Zhao et al. (2015). The rationale for choosing the cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance is to make the term bounded below and invariant to scale. We use the notation EBGAN-PT to refer to the EBGAN auto-encoder model trained with this term. Note the PT is used in the generator loss but not in the discriminator loss.",

We run an exhaustive grid search over a set of architectural choices and hyper-parameters for both frameworks. Formally, we specify the search grid in table 1. We impose the following restrictions on EBGAN models: (i)-using learning rate 0.001 and Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) for both G and D; (ii)nLayerD represents the total number of layers combiningEnc andDec. For simplicity, we fixDec to be one layer and only tune the Enc #layers; (iii)-the margin is set to 10 and not being tuned. To analyze the results, we use the inception score (Salimans et al., 2016) as a numerical means reflecting the generation quality. Some slight modification of the formulation were made to make figure 2 visually more approachable while maintaining the scores original meaning, I = ExKL(p(y)||p(y|x))2 (more details in appendix C). Briefly, higher I score implies better generation quality. Histograms We plot the histogram of I scores in figure 2. We further separated out the optimization related setting from GANs grid (optimD, optimG and lr) and plot the histogram of each subgrid individually, together with the EBGAN I scores as a reference, in figure 3. The number of experiments for GANs and EBGANs are both 512 in every subplot. The histograms evidently show that EBGANs are more reliably trained. 2This form of the inception score is only used to better analyze the grid search in the scope of this work, but not to compare with any other published work.

      "text": "We explore the potential of using the EBGAN framework for semi-supervised learning on permutation-invariant MNIST, collectively on using 100, 200 and 1000 labels. We utilized a bottom- layer-cost Ladder Network (LN) (Rasmus et al., 2015) with the EGBAN framework (EBGAN-LN). Ladder Network can be categorized as an energy-based model that is built with both feedforward and feedback hierarchies powered by stage-wise lateral connections coupling two pathways. One technique we found crucial in enabling EBGAN framework for semi-supervised learning is to gradually decay the margin value m of the equation 1. The rationale behind is to let discriminator punish generator less when pG gets closer to the data manifold. One can think of the extreme case where the contrastive samples are exactly pinned on the data manifold, such that they are not contrastive anymore. This ultimate status happens when m = 0 and the EBGAN-LN model falls back to a normal Ladder Network. The undesirability of a non-decay dynamics for using the discriminator in the GAN or EBGAN framework is also indicated by Theorem 2: on convergence, the discriminator reflects a flat energy surface. However, we posit that the trajectory of learning a EBGAN-LN model does provide the LN (discriminator) more information by letting it see contrastive samples. Yet the optimal way to avoid the mentioned undesirability is to make sure m has been decayed to 0 when the Nash Equilibrium is reached. The margin decaying schedule is found by hyper-parameter search in our experiments (technical details in appendix D). From table 2, it shows that positioning a bottom-layer-cost LN into an EBGAN framework profitably improves the performance of the LN itself. We postulate that within the scope of the EBGAN framework, iteratively feeding the adversarial contrastive samples produced by the generator to the energy function acts as an effective regularizer; the contrastive samples can be thought as an extension to the dataset that provides more information to the classifier. We notice there was a discrepancy between the reported results between Rasmus et al. (2015) and Pezeshki et al.

In the first interpretation, the key component is the generator, and the discriminator plays the role of a trainable objective function. Let us imagine that the data lies on a manifold. Until the generator produces samples that are recognized as being on the manifold, it gets a gradient indicating how to modify its output so it could approach the manifold. In such scenario, the discriminator acts to punish the generator when it produces samples that are outside the manifold. This can be understood as a way to train the generator with a set of possible desired outputs (e.g. the manifold) instead of a single desired output as in traditional supervised learning. For the second interpretation, the key component is the discriminator, and the generator is merely trained to produce contrastive samples.

Training images are scaled into range [-1,1]. Correspondingly the generator output layer is followed by a Tanh function. ReLU is used as the non-linearity function. Initialization: the weights in D fromN (0, 0.002) and in G fromN (0, 0.02). The bias are initial- ized to be 0. We evaluate the models from the grid search by calculating a modified version of the inception score, I = ExKL(p(y)||p(y|x)), where x denotes a generated sample and y is the label predicted by a MNIST classifier that is trained off-line using the entire MNIST training set. Two main changes were made upon its original form: (i)-we swap the order of the distribution pair; (ii)-we omit the e() operation. The modified score condenses the histogram in figure 2 and figure 3. It is also worth noting that although we inherit the name inception score from Salimans et al. (2016), the evaluation isnt related to the inception model trained on ImageNet dataset.

LSUN & CELEBA We use a deep convolutional generator analogous to DCGANs and a deep convolutional autoencoder for the discriminator. The auto-encoder is composed of strided convolution modules in the feedforward pathway and fractional-strided convolution modules in the feedback pathway. We leave the usage of upsampling or switches-unpooling (Zhao et al., 2015) to future research. We also followed the guidance suggested by Radford et al. (2015) for training EBGANs. The configuration of the deep auto-encoder is: Encoder: (64)4c2s-(128)4c2s-(256)4c2s Decoder: (128)4c2s-(64)4c2s-(3)4c2s where (64)4c2s denotes a convolution/deconvolution layer with 64 output feature maps and kernel size 4 with stride 2. The margin m is set to 80 for LSUN and 20 for CelebA. IMAGENET We built deeper models in both 128128 and 256256 experiments, in a similar fashion to section 4.3, 128 128 model: Generator: (1024)4c-(512)4c2s-(256)4c2s-(128)4c2s(64)4c2s-(64)4c2s-(3)3c Noise #planes: 100-64-32-16-8-4 Encoder: (64)4c2s-(128)4c2s-(256)4c2s-(512)4c2s Decoder: (256)4c2s-(128)4c2s-(64)4c2s-(3)4c2s Margin: 40 256 256 model: Generator: (2048)4c-(1024)4c2s-(512)4c2s-(256)4c2s-(128)4c2s(64)4c2s-(64)4c2s-(3)3c Noise #planes: 100-64-32-16-8-4-2 Encoder: (64)4c2s-(128)4c2s-(256)4c2s-(512)4c2s Decoder: (256)4c2s-(128)4c2s-(64)4c2s-(3)4c2s Margin: 80 Note that we feed noise into every layer of the generator where each noise component is initialized into a 4D tensor and concatenated with current feature maps in the feature space. Such strategy is also employed by Salimans et al. (2016).",

      "heading": "D APPENDIX: SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING EXPERIMENT SETTING",
      "text": "BASELINE MODEL As stated in section 4.2, we chose a bottom-layer-cost Ladder Network as our baseline model. Specifically, we utilize an identical architecture as reported in both papers (Rasmus et al., 2015; Pezeshki et al., 2015); namely a fully-connected network of size 784-1000-500-250-250-250, with batch normalization and ReLU following each linear layer. To obtain a strong baseline, we tuned the weight of the reconstruction cost with values from the set 5000784 , 2000 784 , 1000 784 , 500 784, while fixing the weight on the classification cost to 1. In the meantime, we also tuned the learning rate with values 0.002, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001. We adopted Adam as the optimizer with 1 being set to 0.5. The minibatch size was set to 100. All the experiments are finished by 120,000 steps. We use the same learning rate decay mechanism as in the published papers starting from the two-thirds of total steps (i.e., from step #80,000) to linearly decay the learning rate to 0. The result reported in section 4.2 was done by the best tuned setting: L2 = 1000 784 , lr = 0.0002. EBGAN-LN MODEL We place the same Ladder Network architecture into our EBGAN framework and train this EBGANLN model the same way as we train the EBGAN auto-encoder model. For technical details, we started training the EBGAN-LN model from the margin value 16 and gradually decay it to 0 within the first 60,000 steps. By the time, we found that the reconstruction error of the real image had already been low and reached the limitation of the architecture (Ladder Network itself); besides the generated images exhibit good quality (shown in figure 10). Thereafter we turned off training the generator but kept training the discriminator for another 120,000 steps. We set the initial learning rates to be 0.0005 for discriminator and 0.00025 for generator. The other setting is kept consistent with the best baseline LN model. The learning rate decay started at step #120,000 (also two-thirds of the total steps). OTHER DETAILS Notice that we used the 2828 version (unpadded) of the MNIST dataset in the EBGAN-LN experiment. For the EBGAN auto-encoder grid search experiments, we used the zero-padded version, i.e., size 3232. No phenomenal difference has been found due to the zero-padding. We generally took the `2 norm of the discrepancy between input and reconstruction for the loss term in the EBGAN auto-encoder model as formally written in section 2.1. However, for the EBGAN-LN experiment, we followed the original implementation of Ladder Network using a vanilla form of `2 loss. Borrowed from Salimans et al. (2016), the batch normalization is adopted without the learned parameter but merely with a bias term . It still remains unknown whether such trick could affect learning in some non-ignorable way, so this might have made our baseline model not a strict reproduction of the published models by Rasmus et al. (2015) and Pezeshki et al. (2015).",

      "heading": "E APPENDIX: TIPS FOR SETTING A GOOD ENERGY MARGIN VALUE",
      "text": "It is crucial to set a proper energy margin valuem in the framework of EBGAN, from both theoretical and experimental perspective. Hereby we provide a few tips: Delving into the formulation of the discriminator loss made by equation 1, we suggest a numerical balance between its two terms which concern real and fake sample respectively. The second term is apparently bounded by [0,m] (assuming the energy function D(x) is non-negative). It is desirable to make the first term bounded in a similar range. In theory, the upper bound of the first term is essentially determined by (i)-the capacity of D; (ii)-the complexity of the dataset. In practice, for the EBGAN auto-encoder model, one can run D (the auto-encoder) alone on the real sample dataset and monitor the loss. When it converges, the consequential loss implies a rough limit on how well such setting of D is capable to fit the dataset. This usually suggests a good start for a hyper-parameter searching on m. m being overly large results in a training instability/difficulty, while m being too small is prone to the mode-dropping problem. This property of m is depicted in figure 9. One successful technique, as we introduced in appendix D, is to start from a large m and gradually decayed it to 0 along training proceeds. Unlike the feature matching semisupervised learning technique proposed by Salimans et al. (2016), we show in figure 10 that not only does the EBGAN-LN model achieve a good semi-supervised learning performance, it also produces satisfactory generations. Abstracting away from the practical experimental tips, the theoretical understanding of EBGAN in section 2.2 also provides some insight for setting a feasible m. For instance, as implied by Theorem 2, setting a large m results in a broader range of to which D(x) may converge. Instability may come after an overly large because it generates two strong gradients pointing to opposite directions, from loss 1, which would demand more finicky optimization setting.",
