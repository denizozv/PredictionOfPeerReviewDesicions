      "text": "Formulating new hypotheses and testing them is a cognitive process that supports human reasoning and intelligence. This hypothesis testing process involves selective attention, working memory and cognitive control (Just and Carpenter, 1992; Polk and Seifert, 2002). Attention and working memory are engaged in order to maintain, manipulate, and update new hypotheses. Cognitive control is required to inspect and ignore incorrect hypotheses. Inspired by the hypothesis testing process in the human brain and to support dynamic reasoning of machines, in this work, we introduce a reasoning approach that is based on memory augmented neural networks (MANN). A new hypothesis is formed by regressing the original statement (i.e. query in context of QA). Then the hypothesis is tested against reality (i.e. data or document story). If the model is satisfied with the current test response or the hypothesis is true, the reasoning process is halted and the answer is found. Otherwise, another hypothesis is formulated by refining the previous one and the process is repeated until the answer is found. While the idea of modeling hypothesis testing with MANN remains a generic reasoning framework and is applicable to several AI tasks, we apply this approach to cloze-type QA by using Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE). NSE is a flexible MANN architecture and have shown a notable success on several language understanding tasks ranging from sentence classification to language inference and machine translation (Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016). NSE has read, compose and write modules to manipulate external memories and it has introduced a concept of shared and multiple memory accesses, which has shown to be effective for sequence transduction problems. Cloze-type question answering (QA) is a clever way to assess the ability of human and machine to comprehend natural language. This type of tasks are attractive for the natural language processing (NLP) community because the test sets or datasets can be generated without requiring experts supervision, in an automatic manner, which is typically useful in training and testing artificial intelligent (AI) systems that can understand human language. In cloze-type QA setup, the machine is first presented with a text document containing a fact set and then it is asked to output answer for a query related to the document. With the recent development of large-scale Cloze-type QA datasets (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Onishi et al., 2016) and deep neural network methods, remarkable advances have been made in order to solve the problem in an end-to-end fashion. The existing neural network approaches can be broadly divided into single-step or multi-step comprehension depending on how documenting reading and answer inference processes are modeled. By mimicking human readers for a deeper reasoning, the multi-step comprehension systems have shown promising results (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Trischler et al., 2016; Sordoni et al., 2016). However, the current multiturn models are designed with the predefined number of computational hops for inference while the difficulty of document and query pairs can vary. Some of the query-document pairs require a shallow reasoning like word or sentence level matching, but for some of them a deeper document level reasoning or a complex semantic understanding is crucial. The proposed NSE comprehension models perform a reasoning process we called hypothesis-test loop. In each step, a new hypothesis for the correct answer is formed by a query regression. Then the hypothesis is checked and if it is true, the model halts the reasoning process (or the hypothesistest loop) to give the correct answer. To this end, unlike previous methods with fixed computation our models introduce halting procedure in the hypothesis-test loop. When trained with classic back-propagation algorithm, our NSE models show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on two cloze-type QA datasets.",

The reading process mainly involves context modeling with bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNN) and selective focusing with attention mechanism. Hermann et al. (2015) introduced a CNN/Daily News QA task along with a set of baseline models such as Attentive Reader and Impatient Reader. The Attentive Reader model reads the document and the query with bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks and selects a query-relevant context by attending over the document. Chen et al. (2016) re-designed the Attentive Reader model (so called Stanford Attentive Reader) and examined the CNN/Daily News QA task. They found out that roughly 25% of all queries in Hermann et al. (2015)s dataset is unanswerable and the recent neural network approaches have obtained the ceiling performance on this task. Kadlec et al. (2016) proposed an Attention Sum (AS) reader model that first attends over the document and then aggregates all the attention score for the same candidate answer to select the highest scoring candidate as correct answer. However, for complex document and query pairs with deeper semantic association machine reading only once may not be enough and multiple reading and checking is crucial to perform deeper reasoning.",

      "heading": "2.2 MULTI-STEP COMPREHENSION",
      "text": "Similar to a human reader, multi-step comprehension methods read the document and the query before making the final prediction. This kind of comprehension is mostly achieved by implementing an external memory and an attention mechanism to retrieve the query-relevant information from the memory throughout time steps. Hermann et al. (2015)s Impatient Reader revisits the document states with the attention mechanism whenever it reads the next query word in each time scale. Hill et al. (2015) extended multi-hop Memory Networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) with self-supervision to retrieve supporting memory. EpiReader performs a two-stage computation (Trischler et al., 2016). First it chooses a set of most probable answers with the AS model and forms new queries by replacing an answer placeholder in the original query with the candidate answer words. Second EpiReader runs an entailment estimation between the document and the new query pairs to predict the correct answer. Gated Attention (GA) reader extends the AS model with document-gating and iterative reading of the document and the query (Dhingra et al., 2016). The query representation is used as gating for the document and the iterative reading is accomplished by having separate bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks for each computational hop. Iterative Alternative Attention (IAA) reader (Sordoni et al., 2016) is a multi-step comprehension model which uses a GRU network to search for correct answers from a document. In this model, the GRU network is expected to collect evidence from the document and the query that assists prediction in the last time step. Cui et al. (2016) introduced attention-over-attention loss by computing a word level query-document matching matrix. This model provides a fine-grained word-level supervision signal which seems to help model training. Our proposed model performs multiple computational steps for deeper reasoning. Unlike the previous work, in our model the number of steps to revise the document is not predefined and it is dynamically adapted for a particular document and query pair. Furthermore, we define novel ways to substitute query words with a word chosen from the document (i.e. regression process) and to check a hypothesis that the selected document word actually compliments the query (i.e. check process). When the hypothesis is true, our model halts the reading process and outputs the word chosen from the document as the correct answer. NSE is used as a controller for the whole process throughout the reasoning steps. Among the aforementioned models, EpiReader seems to be the most relevant one to our language comprehension models. However, having an entailment estimation introduces a constraint in EpiReader which limits its application. Our model is generic and can be useful in different tasks other than machine comprehension such as language-based conversational tasks, knowledge inference and link prediction. As EpiReader has tightly integrated two-stage neural network modules, the performance directly depends on the first stage. If the first module misses out or fails to choose enough candidates, no correct answer can be found. Our model has no such issue and is not constrained in forming new queries. More recently, the idea of dynamic termination in the context of language comprehension is proposed by Shen et al. (2016) independently. While they use reinforcement learning, we explore two different approaches: adaptive computation and query gating to be fully trained by end-to-end back-propagation.",

      "text": "Our dataset consists of tuples (D,Q,A, a), where D is the document (i.e. passage) serving as a fact for the query Q, A is a set of candidate answers and a A is the true answer. The document and the query are sequences of tokens drawn from a vocabulary V . We train a model to predict the correct answer a from the candidate set A for given a pair of query and document. The main components of our proposed model are shown in Figure 1. First the query and the document memory are initialized via context embedding (omitted from the figure). The memories are then processed with memory read and write operations throughout the hypothesis-test loop. In each step of the loop, the read module formulates a new hypothesis by updating the query memory with relevant content from the document memory. Then the write module tests whether the new hypothesis is true by inspecting the current query and the document states. Selecting relevant content from the document to regress the old query is essentially an inference (i.e. prediction) in our model. Intuitively the input query is regressed toward (becoming) a complete query containing the correct answer word within it. If the write module thinks that the query is complete and the correct answer is found, it halts the hypothesis-test loop. The write module also supervises the query state transitions and retains the right to roll back the new query changes during the reasoning process. To avoid an overconfident prediction and to halt the reasoning process, we explore two different strategies: (a) query gating and (b) adaptive computation. Like a human reader, the model reads the document multiple times, formulates a hypothetical answer for the query and tests it against the story of the document throughout the hypothesis-test steps. Once satisfied with the response of the current hypothesis, the model outputs the response as the correct answer.",

The query memory is evolved over time while the document memory is not updated and rather serves as a fact set for the query. Note that in our model the context embedding network can be any network accepting word embeddings as input, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) or convolutional neural network. We choose BiLSTM because it is able to learn the word-centered context representation effectively by reading text with LSTMs from both left and right and concatenating resulting hidden vectors.",

In each step of the loop, the query memory Mq is updated with content from the document memory to form a new query (i.e. hypothesis formulation). The new query is then checked against the document facts and used to make an answer prediction (i.e. hypothesis testing). The NSE read, compose and write modules collectively perform the following overall process. Read: this module takes in the query and the document states sqt1, sdt1 Rk from the previous time step t 1 as input and computes the alignment vectors lqt R|Q|, ldt R|D|, the new query and the document states sqt , s d t Rk and the query memory key vector z q t R|Q| as follows 1: rt = read LSTM ([sqt1; s d t1]) (3) lqt = r > t M q t1 (4) sqt = softmax(l q t ) >Mqt1 (5) zqt = sigmoid(l q t ) (6) ldt = s q t > Md (7) sdt = softmax(l d t ) >Md (8) Intuitively depending on the previously retrieved document content as well as the previous query states, the read module retrieves from the document a word to be relocated to the query and computes the positions of this word in the query. Since the document word can be located in multiple different positions in the query, sigmoid function is used to normalize the alignment vector lqt . The document state sdt represents the newly retrieved word and the key vector z q t defines its new position in the query memory. Because such a decision is made sequentially in every step, we equip the read module with a LSTM network (i.e. readLSTM ). We initialize the document and the query states sd0, s q 0 with the last hidden states of the query and the document BiLSTM networks. Compose: the compose module combines the current query and document states sqt , sdt and the current hidden state of the read module rt Rk as: ct = compose MLP (sqt , s d t , rt) (9) The resulting single vector ct Rk is passed to the write module for subsequent process. The compose module can be viewed as a feature extractor from the current document and query pair. By taking in the hidden state rt, the compose module also informs the write module of the read modules current decision. Write: this module accepts the outputs of the read module and updates the query memory as follows: Mqt = M q t1z q t + s d t (1 z q t ) (10) where 1 is a matrix of ones. Note that the values of the key vector zqt ranges from zero to one and zero (or near zero) values indicate the query position where the new document word is written. The write module is also responsible for checking the new hypothesis in order to decide whether to halt the hypothesis-test loop for the final answer or to continue. We explore two different strategies to be discussed below. Both methods take in the output of the compose module and employs the LSTM to make the sequential decision.",

Therefore, the gating vector gqt R|Q| have ones for preserving and zeros for erasing content of the old query. This can be seen as a memory gating process which prevents the model from forgetting the old query information. Note that even if the query memory is updated with the document content given by the read module, the write module makes the final decision based on features extracted by the compose module. In other words if the write module decides to keep the old query information, the changes in the new query are simply ignored and the same query from the previous time step is passed along to the next step. The number of steps T in the hypothesis-test loop is a hyperparameter in this model. Therefore, in this setup the write module is expected to lock the query state with its gating mechanism as soon as the hypothesis is true.",

In each time step, the write module outputs a termination score et as follows: wt = write LSTM (ct) (14) et = sigmoid(o >wt) (15) where o Rk is a trainable vector that projects the hidden state wt to a scalar value. Then the probability to halt the hypothesis-test loop after t steps is pt = et t1 i=1 (1 ei) (16) We also introduce a hyperparameter T for the maximum number of permitted steps. If the model runs out of the time without halting the process (after T steps), we force the model to output the final answer in step T .

A pre-trained 300-D Glove 840B vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) were used to initialize the word embedding layer2; therefore the embedding layer size is 300. The hidden layer size of the context embedding BiLSTM nets k = 436. The embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words and the model parameters were randomly initialized from the uniform distribution over [-0.1, 0.1). The gradient 2http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ clipping threshold was set to 15. The models were regularized by applying 20% dropouts to the embedding layer3. We used the batch size n = 32 for the CBT dataset and n = 25 for the WDW dataset and early stopping with a patience of 1 epoch. For the WDW dataset, we anonymized the answer candidates by following the work of Onishi et al. (2016) and Hermann et al. (2015). We run a hyperparameter search over k = 256, 368, 436, 512 , lr = 0.0005, 0.001 and l2 decay = 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00001 on the CBT dev sets to come up with the current setting for training. Among these parameters, the l2 weight decay regularizer did not seem to help and thus it was not applied. We did not tune the dropouts. We used the following batching heuristic in order to speedup the training. We created a temporary example pool by randomly sampling from the training set and sorted them according to the length of the document. Then the first n examples (n = 32 or n = 25) of the ordered pool were put into the same batch, without replacement, and the rest of the pool was replaced back in the training set. This is performed until there is not enough training examples to create a new pool. Finally the documents in the same batch are padded with special symbol to the same length. The batches were regenerated in every epoch to prevent the model from learning a simple mapping function. We also padded queries in the same batch with the special symbol to an equal length.",

We report the performance of our query gating model at the varying number of hypothesis-test steps T = 1, 2, 6, 9, 12 . T for our adaptive computation model was set to 2 or 12. When T = 1, both models update the memory only once and do not have enough time to read it back and thus they are reduced to the same model called NSE (i.e. NSE T = 1). Typically when T is greater than one, the proposed halting strategies result in two different models. Our query gating model achieves 72.6% and 72.0% accuracy on the CBT tasks outperforming all the previous baselines. The performance varies for the different number of steps. For the larger number of allowed steps, the query gating model tends to overfit on the CBT dataset as the performance gap between the dev and test sets increases. Our NSE Adaptive Computation model sets the best score on CBT-NE task with 73.2% accuracy. Overall our NSE models bring modest improvements of 1.2% on CBT-NE and 2.6% on CBT-CN tasks and now the performance differences between the human and the machines are only 8.4% and 9.6%. On the WDW task our single model, NSE with adaptive computation, scores 2.2% and 1.7% higher than the previous best result of Stanford Attentive Reader. The NSE Query Gating model obtains its best result when T = 9. Comparing to the proposed variations of NSE, our Adaptive Computation 3More detail on hyperparameters can be found in our code: https://bitbucket.org/tsendeemts/nse-rc model is more robust and sets new state-of-the-art performance on three out of four tasks by effectively deciding when to halt the reasoning processing with the termination head. Memory locking (to prevent from forgetting) did not show to be as effective as the termination-based approach on this task. In Appendix A, we visualize query regression process in both models and observe that while new queries are generated, query words relevant to the correct answer are not overwritten by the memory write module. The performance of the NSE model with T = 1 matches that of the previous single systems. In general given a small number of permitted steps, the proposed models tend to less overfit but the final performance is not high. As the number of permitted steps increases both dev and test accuracy improves yielding an overall higher performance. However, this holds up to a certain point and with a large permitted steps we no longer observe a significant performance improvement in terms of testing accuracy. For example, NSE Query Gating model with T = 15 (not included in the table) achieved 79.2% dev accuracy and 71.4% test accuracy on CBT-NE task, showing the highest accuracy on the dev set yet massively overfitting on the test set. Furthermore it becomes expensive to train a model with a large number of allowed steps. It is worth noting that even if the proposed models in this work were trained using classic end-toend back-propagation, they can easily be trained with reinforcement learning methods, such as the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992), for further evaluation. Such an adaptation is particularly straightforward for NSE Adaptive Computation because this model has already incorporated a probabilistic termination head in it.",

A.1 QUERY GATING Figure 2 depicts the memory key (zqt ) and the query gate (g q t ) states of the NSE Query Gating model for the input document shown on the top. As noted previously, the model updates the query memory at a position that has a lower memory key value (i.e. the values in the memory key closer to zero indicate the update positions) but rolls back or ignores the new query change if the gating value is one at the same position. The top attended words resulted by the memory read operation define the information for the update. We listed the top-3 attended words in Figure 2, which already includes the correct answer. Note how the the memory key and the gating states are changed during the regression steps. The memory key values are varied across the query positions. Overall the query tokens He and Meadows are pointed to be updated. As proceeding with the query regression, the model effectively adjusts its gates. During the first two steps, the model is willing to accept new updates occurred at certain positions such as He and Meadows. However, the gating value reaches one and the gates are closed in the later steps. The model no longer accepts new query updates in step 6 and is now ready to output the correct answer. Our analysis showed that the model rarely updates the query at the place holder position (i.e. XXXXX in the query). This is desirable in such iterative query regression process. Here the placeholder information remains unchanged in order to be used in the subsequent steps and to inform the model of what part of the query needs to be completed. A.2 ADAPTIVE COMPUTATION In Figure 3, we showed the memory key and the termination head states for an input pair from the CBT dev set. The model actively performs the query regression during the first two steps and then it halts the process as the termination head reaches one in the third step. Interestingly, the memory key points to the most of the query positions for update in the first step and then its values gradually increase in the later steps implying no information exchange between the document and the query.

However, the core contribution—iterative query refinement via read/write/compose operations—is incremental and not sufficiently novel. The two halting strategies (query gating and adaptive computation) are relatively straightforward applications of existing techniques (gating mechanisms and probabilistic termination). While the empirical results are solid, the conceptual advance is limited, the analysis is mostly post-hoc visualization without deep mechanistic insight, and the improvements, though consistent, are modest relative to the added architectural complexity. The work reads as a competent engineering contribution rather than a significant methodological or empirical advance warranting acceptance at a top venue."
