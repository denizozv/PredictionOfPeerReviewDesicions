      "text": "Generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al. (2014)) (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game. One player, the generator, attempts to generate realistic data samples by transforming noisy samples, z, drawn from a simple distribution (e.g., z N (0, 1)) using a transformation function G(z) with learned weights, . The generator receives feedback as to how realistic its synthetic sample is from another player, the discriminator, which attempts to discern between synthetic data samples produced by the generator and samples drawn from an actual dataset using a function D(x) with learned weights, . The GAN framework is one of the more recent successes in a line of research on adversarial training in machine learning (Schmidhuber (1992); Bagnell (2005); Ajakan et al. (2014)) where games between learners are carefully crafted so that Nash equilibria coincide with some set of desired optimality criteria. Preliminary work on GANs focused on generating images (e.g., MNIST (LeCun et al. (1998)), CIFAR (Krizhevsky (2009))), however, GANs have proven useful in a variety of application domains including learning censored representations (Edwards & Storkey (2015)), imitating expert policies (Ho & Ermon (2016)), and domain transfer (Yoo et al. (2016)). Work extending GANs to semi-supervised learning (Chen et al. (2016); Mirza & Osindero (2014); Gauthier (2014); Springenberg (2015)), inference (Makhzani et al. (2015); Dumoulin et al. (2016)), feature learning (Donahue et al. (2016)), and improved image generation (Im et al. (2016); Denton et al. (2015); Radford et al. (2015)) have shown promise as well. Despite these successes, GANs are reputably difficult to train. While research is still underway to improve training techniques and heuristics (Salimans et al. (2016)), most approaches have focused on understanding and generalizing GANs theoretically with the aim of exploring more tractable formulations (Zhao et al. (2016); Li et al. (2015); Uehara et al. (2016); Nowozin et al. (2016)). In this paper, we theoretically and empirically justify generalizing the GAN framework to multiple discriminators. We review GANs and summarize our extension in Section 2. In Sections 3 and 4, we present our N -discriminator extension to the GAN framework (Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks) with several variants which range the role of the discriminator from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher. Section 4.2 explains how this extension makes training with the untampered minimax objective tractable. In Section 5, we define an intuitive metric (GMAM) to quantify GMAN Equal contribution performance and evaluate our framework on a variety of image generation tasks. Section 6 concludes with a summary of our contributions and directions for future research. ContributionsTo summarize, our main contributions are: i) a multi-discriminator GAN framework, GMAN, that allows training with the original, untampered minimax objective; ii) a generative multi-adversarial metric (GMAM) to perform pairwise evaluation of separately trained frameworks; iii) a particular instance of GMAN, GMAN, that allows the generator to automatically regulate training and reach higher performance (as measured by GMAM) in a fraction of the training time required for the standard GAN model.",

      "text": "The original formulation of a GAN is a minimax game between a generator, G(z) : z x, and a discriminator, D(x) : x [0, 1], min G max DD V (D,G) = Expdata(x) [ log(D(x)) ] + Ezpz(z) [ log(1D(G(z))) ] , (1) where pdata(x) is the true data distribution and pz(z) is a simple (usually fixed) distribution that is easy to draw samples from (e.g., N (0, 1)). We differentiate between the function space of discriminators, D, and elements of this space, D. Let pG(x) be the distribution induced by the generator, G(z). We assume D,G to be deep neural networks as is typically the case. In their original work, Goodfellow et al. (2014) proved that given sufficient network capacities and an oracle providing the optimal discriminator, D = argmaxD V (D,G), gradient descent on pG(x) will recover the desired globally optimal solution, pG(x) = pdata(x), so that the generator distribution exactly matches the data distribution. In practice, they replaced the second term, log(1 D(G(z))), with log(D(G(z))) to enhance gradient signals at the start of the game; note this is no longer a zero-sum game. Part of their convergence and optimality proof involves using the oracle, D, to reduce the minimax game to a minimization over G only: min G V (D, G) = min G C(G) = log(4) + 2 JSD(pdata||pG) (2) where JSD denotes Jensen-Shannon divergence. Minimizing C(G) necessarily minimizes JSD, however, we rarely know D and so we instead minimize V (D,G), which is only a lower bound. This perspective of minimizing the distance between the distributions, pdata and pG, motivated Li et al. (2015) to develop a generative model that matches all moments of pG(x) with pdata(x) (at optimality) by minimizing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Another approach, EBGAN, (Zhao et al. (2016)) explores a larger class of games (non-zero-sum games) which generalize the generator and discriminator objectives to take real-valued energies as input instead of probabilities. Nowozin et al. (2016) and then Uehara et al. (2016) extended the JSD perspective on GANs to more general divergences, specifically f -divergences and then Bregman-divergences respectively. In general, these approaches focus on exploring fundamental reformulations of V (D,G). Similarly, our work focuses on a fundamental reformulation, however, our aim is to provide a framework that accelerates training of the generator to a more robust state irrespective of the choice of V .",

Requiring the generator to minimize the max forces G to generate high fidelity samples that must hold up under the scrutiny of all N discriminators, each potentially representing a distinct max. In practice, maxDiD V (Di, G) is not performed to convergence (or global optimality), so the above problem is oversimplified. Furthermore, introducing N discriminators affects the dynamics of the game which affects the trajectories of the discriminators. This prevents us from claiming maxV1(t), . . . , VN (t) > maxV 1(t) t even if we initalize D1(0) = D1(0) as it is unlikely that D1(t) = D 1(t) at some time t after the start of the game.",

The boosted discriminator is given a sample xt and must predict whether it came from the generator or the dataset. The booster then makes its prediction using the predictions of the N weaker Di. There are a few differences between taking the max (case 1) and online boosting (case 2). In case 1, our booster is limited to selecting a single weak discriminator (i.e. a pure strategy), while in case 2, many boosting algorithms more generally use linear combinations of the discriminators. Moreover, in case 2, a booster must make a prediction before receiving a loss function. In case 1, we assume access to the loss function at prediction time, which allows us to compute the max. It is possible to train the weak discriminators using boosting and then ignore the boosters prediction by instead presenting maxVi. We explore both variants in our experiments, using the adaptive algorithm proposed in Beygelzimer et al. (2015). Unfortunately, boosting failed to produce promising results on the image generation tasks. It is possible that boosting produces too strong an adversary for learning which motivates the next section.

Our next perspective asks the question, Is maxD V (D,G) too harsh a critic? 4.1 Soft-DISCRIMINATOR In practice, training against a far superior discriminator can impede the generators learning. This is because the generator is unlikely to generate any samples considered realistic by the discriminators standards, and so the generator will receive uniformly negative feedback. This is problem- atic because the information contained in the gradient derived from negative feedback only dictates where to drive down pG(x), not specifically where to increase pG(x). Furthermore, driving down pG(x) necessarily increases pG(x) in other regions of X (to maintain X pG(x) = 1) which may or may not contain samples from the true dataset (whack-a-mole dilemma). In contrast, a generator is more likely to see positive feedback against a more lenient discriminator, which may better guide a generator towards amassing pG(x) in approximately correct regions of X . For this reason, we explore a variety of functions that allow us to soften the max operator. We choose to focus on soft versions of the three classical Pythagorean means parameterized by where = 0 corresponds to the mean and the max is recovered as : AMsoft(V, ) = N i wiVi (3) GMsoft(V, ) = exp ( N i wi log(Vi) ) (4) HMsoft(V, ) = ( N i wiV 1 i )1 (5) wherewi = eVi/jeVj with 0, Vi < 0. Using a softmax also has the well known advantage of being differentiable (as opposed to subdifferentiable for max). Note that we only require continuity to guarantee that computing the softmax is actually equivalent to computing V (D,G) where D is some convex combination of Di (see Appendix A.5).",

(6) where z = N i (1Di(x)). Note that the generator gradient, | log(z) z |, is minimized at z = 1 over z (0, 1]1. From this form, it is clear that z = 1 if and only if Di = 0i, so G only receives a vanishing gradient if all Di agree that the sample is fake; this is especially unlikely for large N . In other words,G only needs to fool a singleDi to receive constructive feedback. This result allows the generator to successfully minimize the original generator objective, log(1D). This is in contrast to the more popular log(D) introduced to artificially enhance gradients at the start of training. At the beginning of training, when maxDi V (Di, G) is likely too harsh a critic for the generator, we can set closer to zero to use the mean, increasing the odds of providing constructive feedback to the generator. In addition, the discriminators have the added benefit of functioning as an ensemble, reducing the variance of the feedback presented to the generator, which is especially important when the discriminators are far from optimal and are still learning a reasonable decision boundary. As training progresses and the discriminators improve, we can increase to become more critical of the generator for more refined training.",

      "text": "We argue for this ensemble approach on a more fundamental level as well. Here, we draw on the density ratio estimation perspective of GANs (Uehara et al. (2016)). The original GAN proof assumes we have access to pdata(x), if only implicitly. In most cases of interest, the discriminator only has access to a finite dataset sampled from pdata(x); therefore, when computing expectations of V (D,G), we only draw samples from our finite dataset. This is equivalent to training a GAN with pdata(x) = pdata which is a distribution consisting of point masses on all the data points in the dataset. For the sake of argument, lets assume we are training a discriminator and generator, each 1GV = i Di z Di G j 6=i(1Dj) = 1 z Dk G for Dk = 1, D 6=k = 0. Our argument ignores DkG . with infinite capacity. In this case, the global optimum (pG(x) = pdata(x)) fails to capture any of the interesting structure from pdata(x), the true distribution we are trying to learn. Therefore, it is actually critical that we avoid this global optimum. In practice, this degenerate result is avoided by employing learners with limited capacity and corrupting data samples with noise (i.e., dropout), but we might better accomplish this by simultaneously training a variety of limited capacity discriminators. With this approach, we might obtain a diverse set of seemingly tenable hypotheses for the true pdata(x). Averaging over these multiple locally optimal discriminators increases the entropy of pdata(x) by diffusing the probability mass over the data space (see Figure 2 for an example).",

Issues with unstable dynamics, oscillatory behavior, and generator collapse are not uncommon. In addition, the discriminator is often times able to achieve a high degree of classification accuracy (producing a single scalar) before the generator has made sufficient progress on the arguably more difficult generative task (producing a high dimensional sample). Salimans et al. (2016) suggested label smoothing to reduce the vulnerability of the generator to a relatively superior discriminator. Here, we explore an approach that enables the generator to automatically temper the performance of the discriminator when necessary, but still encourages the generator to challenge itself against more accurate adversaries. Specifically, we augment the generator objective: min G,>0 FG(Vi) f() (7) where f() is monotonically increasing in which appears in the softmax equations, (3)(5). In experiments, we simply set f() = c with c a constant (e.g., 0.001).

Increasing the number of discriminators from 2 to 5 on CIFAR-10 significantly improves scores over the standard GAN both in terms of the GMAM metric and Inception scores. A.3 GENERATED IMAGES See Figures 14 and 15. A.4 SOMEWHAT RELATED WORK A GAN framework with two discriminators appeared in Yoo et al. (2016), however, it is applicable only in a semi-supervised case where a label can be assigned to subsets of the dataset (e.g., X = X1 = Domain 1,X2 = Domain 2, . . .). In contrast, our framework applies to an unsupervised scenario where an obvious partition of the dataset is unknown. Furthermore, extending GMAN to the semi-supervised domain-adaptation scenario would suggest multiple discriminators per domain, therefore our line of research is strictly orthogonal to that of their multi-domain discriminator approach. Also, note that assigning a discriminator to each domain is akin to prescribing a new discriminator to each value of a conditional variable in conditional GANs (Mirza & Osindero (2014)). In this case, we interpret GMAN as introducing multiple conditional discriminators and not a discriminator for each of the possibly exponentially many conditional labels. In Section 4.4, we describe an approach to customize adversarial training to better suit the development of the generator. An approach with similar conceptual underpinnings was described in Ravanbakhsh et al. (2016), however, similar to the above, it is only admissible in a semi-supervised scenario whereas our applies to the unsupervised case. A.5 Softmax REPRESENTABILITY Let softmax(Vi) = V [minVi ,maxVi ]. Also let a = argmini Vi, b = argmaxi Vi, and V(t) = V ((1 t)Da + tDb) so that V(0) = Va and V(1) = Vb. The softmax and minimax objective V (Di, G) are both continuous in their inputs, so by the intermediate value theorem, we have that t [0, 1] s.t. V(t) = V , which implies D D s.t. V (D,G) = V . This result implies that the softmax (and any other continuous substitute) can be interpreted as returning V (D,G) for some D selected by computing an another, unknown function over the space of the discriminators. This result holds even if D is not representable by the architecture chosen for Ds neural network. A.6 UNCONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION To convert GMAN minimax formulation to an unconstrained minimax formulation, we introduce an auxiliary variable, , define () = log(1 + e), and let the generator minimize over R. A.7 BOOSTING WITH AdaBoost.OL AdaBoost.OL (Beygelzimer et al. (2015)) does not require knowledge of the weak learners slight edge over random guessing (P (correct label) = 0.5 + (0, 0.5]), and in fact, allows < 0. This is crucial because our weak learners are deep nets with unknown, possibly negative, s. A.8 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP All experiments were conducted using an architecture similar to DCGAN (Radford et al. (2015)). We use convolutional transpose layers (Zeiler et al. (2010)) for G and strided convolutions for D except for the input of G and the last layer of D. We use the single step gradient method as in (Nowozin et al. (2016)), and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy (2015)) was used in each of the generator layers. The different discriminators were trained with varying dropout rates from [0.3, 0.7]. Variations in the discriminators were effected in two ways. We varied the architecture by varying the number of filters in the discriminator layers (reduced by factors of 2, 4 and so on), as well as varying dropout rates. Secondly we also decorrelated the samples that the disriminators were training on by splitting the minibatch across the discriminators. The code was written in Tensorflow (Abadi et al. (2016)) and run on Nvidia GTX 980 GPUs. Code to reproduce experiments and plots is at https://github.com/iDurugkar/GMAN. Specifics for the MNIST architecture and training are: Generator latent variables z U (1, 1)100 Generator convolution transpose layers: (4, 4, 128) , (8, 8, 64) , (16, 16, 32) , (32, 32, 1) Base Discriminator architecture: (32, 32, 1) , (16, 16, 32) , (8, 8, 64) , (4, 4, 128).
