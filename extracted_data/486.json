      "text": "We consider the problem of classifying nodes (such as documents) in a graph (such as a citation network), where labels are only available for a small subset of nodes. This problem can be framed as graph-based semi-supervised learning, where label information is smoothed over the graph via some form of explicit graph-based regularization (Zhu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Belkin et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2012), e.g. by using a graph Laplacian regularization term in the loss function: L = L0 + Lreg , with Lreg = i,j Aijf(Xi) f(Xj)2 = f(X)>f(X) . (1) Here, L0 denotes the supervised loss w.r.t. the labeled part of the graph, f() can be a neural networklike differentiable function, is a weighing factor and X is a matrix of node feature vectors Xi. = D A denotes the unnormalized graph Laplacian of an undirected graph G = (V, E) with N nodes vi V , edges (vi, vj) E , an adjacency matrix A RNN (binary or weighted) and a degree matrix Dii = j Aij . The formulation of Eq. 1 relies on the assumption that connected nodes in the graph are likely to share the same label. This assumption, however, might restrict modeling capacity, as graph edges need not necessarily encode node similarity, but could contain additional information. In this work, we encode the graph structure directly using a neural network model f(X,A) and train on a supervised target L0 for all nodes with labels, thereby avoiding explicit graph-based regularization in the loss function. Conditioning f() on the adjacency matrix of the graph will allow the model to distribute gradient information from the supervised loss L0 and will enable it to learn representations of nodes both with and without labels. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a simple and well-behaved layer-wise propagation rule for neural network models which operate directly on graphs and show how it can be motivated from a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions (Hammond et al., 2011). Secondly, we demonstrate how this form of a graph-based neural network model can be used for fast and scalable semi-supervised classification of nodes in a graph. Experiments on a number of datasets demonstrate that our model compares favorably both in classification accuracy and efficiency (measured in wall-clock time) against state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised learning.",

      "text": "We consider spectral convolutions on graphs defined as the multiplication of a signal x RN (a scalar for every node) with a filter g = diag() parameterized by RN in the Fourier domain, i.e.: g ? x = UgU >x , (3) where U is the matrix of eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian L = IN D 1 2AD 1 2 = UU>, with a diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues and U>x being the graph Fourier transform of x. We can understand g as a function of the eigenvalues of L, i.e. g(). Evaluating Eq. 3 is computationally expensive, as multiplication with the eigenvector matrix U isO(N2). Furthermore, computing the eigendecomposition of L in the first place might be prohibitively expensive for large graphs. To circumvent this problem, it was suggested in Hammond et al. (2011) that g() can be well-approximated by a truncated expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials Tk(x) up to K th order: g() K k=0 kTk() , (4) with a rescaled = 2max IN . max denotes the largest eigenvalue of L. RK is now a vector of Chebyshev coefficients. The Chebyshev polynomials are recursively defined as Tk(x) = 2xTk1(x) Tk2(x), with T0(x) = 1 and T1(x) = x. The reader is referred to Hammond et al. (2011) for an in-depth discussion of this approximation. Going back to our definition of a convolution of a signal x with a filter g , we now have: g ? x K k=0 kTk(L)x , (5) with L = 2maxL IN ; as can easily be verified by noticing that (UU >)k = UkU>. Note that this expression is nowK-localized since it is aK th-order polynomial in the Laplacian, i.e. it depends only on nodes that are at maximum K steps away from the central node (K th-order neighborhood). The complexity of evaluating Eq. 5 is O(|E|), i.e. linear in the number of edges. Defferrard et al. (2016) use this K-localized convolution to define a convolutional neural network on graphs.",

      "text": "A neural network model based on graph convolutions can therefore be built by stacking multiple convolutional layers of the form of Eq. 5, each layer followed by a point-wise non-linearity. Now, imagine we limited the layer-wise convolution operation to K = 1 (see Eq. 5), i.e. a function that is linear w.r.t. L and therefore a linear function on the graph Laplacian spectrum. 1We provide an alternative interpretation of this propagation rule based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm (Weisfeiler & Lehmann, 1968) in Appendix A. In this way, we can still recover a rich class of convolutional filter functions by stacking multiple such layers, but we are not limited to the explicit parameterization given by, e.g., the Chebyshev polynomials. We intuitively expect that such a model can alleviate the problem of overfitting on local neighborhood structures for graphs with very wide node degree distributions, such as social networks, citation networks, knowledge graphs and many other real-world graph datasets. Additionally, for a fixed computational budget, this layer-wise linear formulation allows us to build deeper models, a practice that is known to improve modeling capacity on a number of domains (He et al., 2016). In this linear formulation of a GCN we further approximate max 2, as we can expect that neural network parameters will adapt to this change in scale during training. Under these approximations Eq. 5 simplifies to: g ? x 0x+ 1 (L IN )x = 0x 1D 1 2AD 1 2x , (6) with two free parameters 0 and 1. The filter parameters can be shared over the whole graph. Successive application of filters of this form then effectively convolve the kth-order neighborhood of a node, where k is the number of successive filtering operations or convolutional layers in the neural network model. In practice, it can be beneficial to constrain the number of parameters further to address overfitting and to minimize the number of operations (such as matrix multiplications) per layer. This leaves us with the following expression: g ? x ( IN +D 12AD 1 2 ) x , (7) with a single parameter = 0 = 1. Note that IN + D 1 2AD 1 2 now has eigenvalues in the range [0, 2]. Repeated application of this operator can therefore lead to numerical instabilities and exploding/vanishing gradients when used in a deep neural network model. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the following renormalization trick: IN +D 1 2AD 1 2 D 12 AD 12 , with A = A+ IN and Dii = j Aij . We can generalize this definition to a signalX RNC withC input channels (i.e. aC-dimensional feature vector for every node) and F filters or feature maps as follows: Z = D 1 2 AD 1 2X , (8) where RCF is now a matrix of filter parameters and Z RNF is the convolved signal matrix. This filtering operation has complexity O(|E|FC), as AX can be efficiently implemented as a product of a sparse matrix with a dense matrix.",

Recently, attention has shifted to models that learn graph embeddings with methods inspired by the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013). DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) learns embeddings via the prediction of the local neighborhood of nodes, sampled from random walks on the graph. LINE (Tang et al., 2015) and node2vec (Grover & Leskovec, 2016) extend DeepWalk with more sophisticated random walk or breadth-first search schemes. For all these methods, however, a multistep pipeline including random walk generation and semi-supervised training is required where each step has to be optimized separately.

Their framework requires the repeated application of contraction maps as propagation functions until node representations reach a stable fixed point. This restriction was later alleviated in Li et al. (2016) by introducing modern practices for recurrent neural network training to the original graph neural network framework. Duvenaud et al. (2015) introduced a convolution-like propagation rule on graphs and methods for graph-level classification. Their approach requires to learn node degree-specific weight matrices which does not scale to large graphs with wide node degree distributions. Our model instead uses a single weight matrix per layer and deals with varying node degrees through an appropriate normalization of the adjacency matrix (see Section 3.1). A related approach to node classification with a graph-based neural network was recently introduced in Atwood & Towsley (2016). They report O(N2) complexity, limiting the range of possible applications. In a different yet related model, Niepert et al. (2016) convert graphs locally into sequences that are fed into a conventional 1D convolutional neural network, which requires the definition of a node ordering in a pre-processing step. Our method is based on spectral graph convolutional neural networks, introduced in Bruna et al. (2014) and later extended by Defferrard et al. (2016) with fast localized convolutions. In contrast to these works, we consider here the task of transductive node classification within networks of significantly larger scale. We show that in this setting, a number of simplifications (see Section 2.2) can be introduced to the original frameworks of Bruna et al. (2014) and Defferrard et al.

NELL (Carlson et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2016) is a bipartite graph dataset extracted from a knowledge graph with 55,864 relation nodes and 9,891 entity nodes. Citation networks We consider three citation network datasets: Citeseer, Cora and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008). The datasets contain sparse bag-of-words feature vectors for each document and a list of citation links between documents. We treat the citation links as (undirected) edges and construct a binary, symmetric adjacency matrix A. Each document has a class label. For training, we only use 20 labels per class, but all feature vectors. NELL NELL is a dataset extracted from the knowledge graph introduced in (Carlson et al., 2010). A knowledge graph is a set of entities connected with directed, labeled edges (relations). We follow the pre-processing scheme as described in Yang et al. (2016). We assign separate relation nodes r1 and r2 for each entity pair (e1, r, e2) as (e1, r1) and (e2, r2). Entity nodes are described by sparse feature vectors. We extend the number of features in NELL by assigning a unique one-hot representation for every relation node, effectively resulting in a 61,278-dim sparse feature vector per node. The semi-supervised task here considers the extreme case of only a single labeled example per class in the training set. We construct a binary, symmetric adjacency matrix from this graph by setting entries Aij = 1, if one or more edges are present between nodes i and j. Random graphs We simulate random graph datasets of various sizes for experiments where we measure training time per epoch. For a dataset with N nodes we create a random graph assigning 2N edges uniformly at random.

We have shown that for large graphs that do not fit in GPU memory, training on CPU can still be a viable option. Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent can alleviate this issue. The procedure of generating mini-batches, however, should take into account the number of layers in the GCN model, as the K th-order neighborhood for a GCN with K layers has to be stored in memory for an exact procedure. For very large and densely connected graph datasets, further approximations might be necessary. Directed edges and edge features Our framework currently does not naturally support edge features and is limited to undirected graphs (weighted or unweighted). Results on NELL however show that it is possible to handle both directed edges and edge features by representing the original directed graph as an undirected bipartite graph with additional nodes that represent edges in the original graph (see Section 5.1 for details). Limiting assumptions Through the approximations introduced in Section 2, we implicitly assume locality (dependence on the K th-order neighborhood for a GCN with K layers) and equal importance of self-connections vs. edges to neighboring nodes.

A well-studied framework for the unique assignment of node labels given a graph and (optionally) discrete initial node labels is provided by the 1-dim Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL-1) algorithm (Weisfeiler & Lehmann, 1968): Algorithm 1: WL-1 algorithm (Weisfeiler & Lehmann, 1968) Input: Initial node coloring (h(0)1 , h (0) 2 , ..., h (0) N ) Output: Final node coloring (h(T )1 , h (T ) 2 , ..., h (T ) N ) t 0; repeat for vi V do h (t+1) i hash ( jNi h (t) j ) ; t t+ 1; until stable node coloring is reached; Here, h(t)i denotes the coloring (label assignment) of node vi (at iteration t) and Ni is its set of neighboring node indices (irrespective of whether the graph includes self-connections for every node or not). hash() is a hash function. For an in-depth mathematical discussion of the WL-1 algorithm see, e.g., Douglas (2011). We can replace the hash function in Algorithm 1 with a neural network layer-like differentiable function with trainable parameters as follows: h (l+1) i = jNi 1 cij h (l) j W (l) , (12) where cij is an appropriately chosen normalization constant for the edge (vi, vj). Further, we can take h(l)i now to be a vector of activations of node i in the l th neural network layer. W (l) is a layer-specific weight matrix and () denotes a differentiable, non-linear activation function. By choosing cij = didj , where di = |Ni| denotes the degree of node vi, we recover the propagation rule of our Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model in vector form (see Eq. 2)5. Thisloosely speakingallows us to interpret our GCN model as a differentiable and parameterized generalization of the 1-dim Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm on graphs. A.1 NODE EMBEDDINGS WITH RANDOM WEIGHTS From the analogy with the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, we can understand that even an untrained GCN model with random weights can serve as a powerful feature extractor for nodes in a graph. As an example, consider the following 3-layer GCN model: Z = tanh ( A tanh ( A tanh ( AXW (0) ) W (1) ) W (2) ) , (13) with weight matricesW (l) initialized at random using the initialization described in Glorot & Bengio (2010). A, X and Z are defined as in Section 3.1. We apply this model on Zacharys karate club network (Zachary, 1977). This graph contains 34 nodes, connected by 154 (undirected and unweighted) edges. Every node is labeled by one of four classes, obtained via modularity-based clustering (Brandes et al., 2008). See Figure 3a for an illustration. 5Note that we here implicitly assume that self-connections have already been added to every node in the graph (for a clutter-free notation). We take a featureless approach by setting X = IN , where IN is the N by N identity matrix. N is the number of nodes in the graph. Note that nodes are randomly ordered (i.e. ordering contains no information). Furthermore, we choose a hidden layer dimensionality6 of 4 and a two-dimensional output (so that the output can immediately be visualized in a 2-dim plot). Figure 3b shows a representative example of node embeddings (outputs Z) obtained from an untrained GCN model applied to the karate club network. These results are comparable to embeddings obtained from DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), which uses a more expensive unsupervised training procedure. A.2 SEMI-SUPERVISED NODE EMBEDDINGS On this simple example of a GCN applied to the karate club network it is interesting to observe how embeddings react during training on a semi-supervised classification task. Such a visualization (see Figure 4) provides insights into how the GCN model can make use of the graph structure (and of features extracted from the graph structure at later layers) to learn embeddings that are useful for a classification task. We consider the following semi-supervised learning setup: we add a softmax layer on top of our model (Eq. 13) and train using only a single labeled example per class (i.e. a total number of 4 labeled nodes). We train for 300 training iterations using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.01 on a cross-entropy loss. Figure 4 shows the evolution of node embeddings over a number of training iterations. The model succeeds in linearly separating the communities based on minimal supervision and the graph structure alone. A video of the full training process can be found on our website7. 6We originally experimented with a hidden layer dimensionality of 2 (i.e. same as output layer), but observed that a dimensionality of 4 resulted in less frequent saturation of tanh() units and therefore visually more pleasing results. 7http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/",

      "heading": "B EXPERIMENTS ON MODEL DEPTH",
      "text": "In these experiments, we investigate the influence of model depth (number of layers) on classification performance. We report results on a 5-fold cross-validation experiment on the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed datasets (Sen et al., 2008) using all labels. In addition to the standard GCN model (Eq. 2), we report results on a model variant where we use residual connections (He et al., 2016) between hidden layers to facilitate training of deeper models by enabling the model to carry over information from the previous layers input: H(l+1) = ( D 1 2 AD 1 2H(l)W (l) ) +H(l) . (14) On each cross-validation split, we train for 400 epochs (without early stopping) using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.01. Other hyperparameters are chosen as follows: 0.5 (dropout rate, first and last layer), 5 104 (L2 regularization, first layer), 16 (number of units for each hidden layer) and 0.01 (learning rate). Results are summarized in Figure 5. For the datasets considered here, best results are obtained with a 2- or 3-layer model. We observe that for models deeper than 7 layers, training without the use of residual connections can become difficult, as the effective context size for each node increases by the size of its K th-order neighborhood (for a model with K layers) with each additional layer. Furthermore, overfitting can become an issue as the number of parameters increases with model depth.",
