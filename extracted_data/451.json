  "abstract": "The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest  in the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of  high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using spin glass  models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model.  In this work, we do not make any such approximation and study conditions  on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence  of bad local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two  important folklore facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology  from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii) that the energy landscape  in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.  The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address.  We study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce an algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale networks.  Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected throughout  all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they become  exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to what is observed in practice with  very low curvature attractors.",

      "text": "Optimization is a critical component in deep learning, governing its success in different areas of computer vision, speech processing and natural language processing. The prevalent optimization strategy is Stochastic Gradient Descent, invented by Robbins and Munro in the 50s. The empirical performance of SGD on these models is better than one could expect in generic, arbitrary non-convex loss surfaces, often aided by modifications yielding significant speedups Duchi et al. (2011); Hinton et al. (2012); Ioffe & Szegedy (2015); Kingma & Ba (2014). This raises a number of theoretical questions as to why neural network optimization does not suffer in practice from poor local minima. The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest in the optimization and machine learning communities as a paradigmatic example of a hard, high-dimensional, non-convex problem. Recent work has explored models from statistical physics such as spin glasses Choromanska et al. (2015), in order to understand the macroscopic properties of the system, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model. Other authors have advocated that the real danger in high-dimensional setups are saddle points rather than poor local minima Dauphin et al. (2014), although recent results rigorously establish that gradient descent does not get stuck on saddle points Lee et al. (2016) but merely slowed down. Other notable recent contributions are Kawaguchi (2016), which further develops the spin-glass connection from Choromanska et al. (2015) and resolves the linear case by showing that no poor local minima exist; Sagun et al. (2014) which also Currently on leave from UC Berkeley. discusses the impact of stochastic vs plain gradient, Soudry & Carmon (2016), that studies Empirical Risk Minimization for piecewise multilayer neural networks under overparametrization (which needs to grow with the amount of available data), and Goodfellow et al. (2014), which provided insightful intuitions on the loss surface of large deep learning models and partly motivated our work. Additionally, the work Safran & Shamir (2015) studies some topological properties of homogeneous nonlinear networks and shows how overparametrization acts upon these properties, and the pioneering Shamir (2016) studied the distribution-specific hardness of optimizing non-convex objectives. Lastly, several papers submitted concurrently and independently of this one deserve note, particularly Swirszcz et al. (2016) which analyzes the explicit criteria under which sigmoid-based neural networks become trapped by poor local minima, as well as Tian (2017), which offers a complementary study of two layer ReLU based networks, and their learning dynamics. In this work, we do not make any linearity assumption and study conditions on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence of bad local minima. The loss surface F () of a given model can be expressed in terms of its level sets , which contain for each energy level all parameters yielding a loss smaller or equal than . A first question we address concerns the topology of these level sets, i.e. under which conditions they are connected. Connected level sets imply that one can always find a descent direction at each energy level, and therefore that no poor local minima can exist. In absence of nonlinearities, deep (linear) networks have connected level sets Kawaguchi (2016). We first generalize this result to include ridge regression (in the two layer case) and provide an alternative, more direct proof of the general case. We then move to the half-rectified case and show that the topology is intrinsically different and clearly dependent on the interplay between data distribution and model architecture. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay. Beyond the question of whether the loss contains poor local minima or not, the immediate follow-up question that determines the convergence of algorithms in practice is the local conditioning of the loss surface. It is thus related not to the topology but to the shape or geometry of the level sets. As the energy level decays, one expects the level sets to exhibit more complex irregular structures, which correspond to regions where F () has small curvature. In order to verify this intuition, we introduce an efficient algorithm to estimate the geometric regularity of these level sets by approximating geodesics of each level set starting at two random boundary points. Our algorithm uses dynamic programming and can be efficiently deployed to study mid-scale CNN architectures on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and RNN models on Penn Treebank next word prediction. Our empirical results show that these models have a nearly convex behavior up until their lowest test errors, with a single connected component that becomes more elongated as the energy decays. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical results on the topological connectedness of multilayer networks. Section 3 presents our path discovery algorithm and Section 4 covers the numerical experiments.",

For simplicity, we consider first a strict notion of local minima: RS is a strict local minima of F if there is > 0 with F () > F () for all B(, ) and 6= . In particular, we are interested to know whether Fe has local minima which are not global minima. This question is answered by knowing whether F () is connected at each energy level : Proposition 2.1. If F () is connected for all then every local minima of F () is a global minima. Strict local minima implies that F () = 0 and HF () 0, but avoids degenerate cases where F is constant along a manifold intersecting . In that scenario, if U denotes that manifold, our reasoning immediately implies that if F () are connected, then for all > 0 there exists with dist(,U) and F () 0. This proposition shows that a sufficient condition to prevent the existence of poor local minima is having connected level sets, but this condition is not necessary: one can have isolated local minima lying at the same energy level. This can be the case in systems that are defined up to a discrete symmetry group, such as multilayer neural networks. However, as we shall see next, this case puts the system in a brittle position, since one needs to be able to account for all the local minima (and there can be exponentially many of them as the parameter dimensionality increases) and verify that their energy is indeed equal.",

This model defines a non-convex (and non-concave) loss Fe(). When = 0, it has been shown in Saxe et al. (2013) and Kawaguchi (2016) that in this case, every local minima is a global minima. We provide here an alternative proof of that result that uses a somewhat simpler argument and allows for > 0 in the case K = 2. Proposition 2.2. Let W1,W2, . . . ,WK be weight matrices of sizes nk nk+1, k 0 when K = 2; and therefore there are no poor local minima in these cases. Moreover, any can be connected to the lowest energy level with a strictly decreasing path. Let us highlight that this result is slightly complementary than that of Kawaguchi (2016), Theorem 2.3. Whereas we require nj min(n1, nK) for j = 2 . . .K 1 and our analysis does not inform about the order of the saddle points, we do not need full rank assumptions on X nor the weights Wk. This result does also highlight a certain mismatch between the picture of having no poor local minima and generalization error. Incorporating regularization drastically changes the topology, and the fact that we are able to show connectedness only in the two-layer case with ridge regression is profound; we conjecture that extending it to deeper models requires a different regularization, perhaps using more general atomic norms Bach (2013). But we now move our interest to the nonlinear case, which is more relevant to our purposes.",

      "text": "One may wonder whether the same phenomena of global connectedness also holds in the halfrectified case. A simple motivating counterexample shows that this is not the case in general. Consider a simple setup with X R2 drawn from a mixture of two Gaussians N1 and N1, and let Y = (X Z) Z , where Z is the (hidden) mixture component taking 1,1 values. Let Y = (X; W1,W2) be a single-hidden layer ReLU network, with two hidden units. Let A be a configuration that bisects the two mixture components, and let B the same configuration, but swapping the bisectrices. One can verify that they can both achieve arbitrarily small risk by letting the covariance of the mixture components go to 0. However, any path that connects A to B must necessarily pass through a point in which W1 has rank 1, which leads to an estimator with risk at least 1/2. In fact, it is easy to see that this counter-example can be extended to any generic half-rectified architecture, if one is allowed to adversarially design a data distribution. For any given (X; ) with arbitrary architecture and current parameters = (Wi), let P = A1, . . . ,AS be the underlying tessellation of the input space given by our current choice of parameters; that is, (X; ) is piece-wise linear and P contains those pieces. Now let X be any arbitrary distribution with density p(x) > 0 for all x Rn, for example a Gaussian, and let Y | X d= (X; ) . Since is invariant under a subgroup of permutations of its hidden layers, it is easy to see that one can find two parameter values A = and B = such that Fo(A) = Fo(B) = 0, but any continuous path (t) from A to B will have a different tessellation and therefore wont satisfy Fo((t)) = 0. Moreover, one can build on this counter-example to show that not only the level sets are disconnected, but also that there exist poor local minima. Let be a different set of parameters, and Y | X d= (X; ) be a different target distribution. Now consider the data distribution given by the mixture X | p(x) , z Bernoulli() , Y | X, z d= z(X; ) + (1 z)(X; ) . By adjusting the mixture component we can clearly change the risk at and and make them different, but we conjecture that this preserves the status of local minima of and . Appendix E constructs a counter-example numerically. This illustrates an intrinsic difficulty in the optimization landscape if one is after universal guarantees that do not depend upon the data distribution. This difficulty is non-existent in the linear case and not easy to exploit in mean-field approaches such as Choromanska et al. (2015), and shows that in general we should not expect to obtain connected level sets. However, connectedness can be recovered if one is willing to accept a small increase of energy and make some assumptions on the complexity of the regression task. Our main result shows that the amount by which the energy is allowed to increase is upper bounded by a quantity that trades-off model overparametrization and smoothness in the data distribution. For that purpose, we start with a characterization of the oracle loss, and for simplicity let us assume Y R and let us first consider the case with a single hidden layer and `1 regularization: R() = 1.",

      "text": "Before proving our main result, we need to introduce preliminary notation and results. We first describe the case with a single hidden layer of size m. We define e(m) = min W1Rmn,W1(i)21,W2Rm E|(X; ) Y |2+ W21 . (6) to be the oracle risk using m hidden units with norm 1 and using sparse regression. It is a well known result by Hornik and Cybenko that a single hidden layer is a universal approximator under very mild assumptions, i.e. limm e(m) = 0. This result merely states that our statistical setup is consistent, and it should not be surprising to the reader familiar with classic approximation theory. A more interesting question is the rate at which e(m) decays, which depends on the smoothness of the joint density (X,Y ) P relative to the nonlinear activation family we have chosen. For convenience, we redefine W = W1 and = W2 and Z(W ) = max(0,WX). We also write z(w) = max(0, w,X) where (X,Y ) P and w RN is any deterministic vector. Let X = EPXXT RNN be the covariance operator of the random input X . We assume X <. A fundamental property that will be essential to our analysis is that, despite the fact that Z is nonlinear, the quantity [w1, w2]Z := EP z(w1)z(w2) is locally equivalent to the linear metric w1, w2X = EP wT1 XXTw2 = w1,Xw2, and that the linearization error decreases with the angle between w1 and w2. Without loss of generality, we assume here that w1 = w2 = 1, and we write w2Z = E|z(w)|2. Proposition 2.3. Let = cos1(w1, w2) be the angle between unitary vectors w1 and w2 and let wm = w1+w2 w1+w2 be their unitary bisector. Then 1 + cos 2 wm2Z 2X ( 1 cos 2 + sin2 ) [w1, w2]Z 1 + cos 2 wm2Z . (7) The term X is overly pessimistic: we can replace it by the energy of X projected into the subspace spanned byw1 andw2 (which is bounded by 2X). When is small, a Taylor expansion of the trigonometric terms reveals that 2 3X w1, w2 = 2 3X cos = 2 3X (1 2 2 +O(4)) (1 2/4)wm2Z X(2/4 + 2) +O(4) [w1, w2]Z +O(4) , and similarly [w1, w2]Z w1, w2wm2Z Xw1, w2 . The local behavior of parameters w1, w2 on our regression problem is thus equivalent to that of having a linear layer, provided w1 and w2 are sufficiently close to each other. This result can be seen as a spoiler of what is coming: increasing the hidden layer dimensionality m will increase the chances to encounter pairs of vectors w1, w2 with small angle; and with it some hope of approximating the previous linear behavior thanks to the small linearization error. In order to control the connectedness, we need a last definition. Given a hidden layer of size m with current parameters W Rnm, we define a robust compressibility factor as W (l, ;m) = min 0l,supi |(wi,wi)| E|Y Z(W )|2 + 1 , (l m) . (8) This quantity thus measures how easily one can compress the current hidden layer representation, by keeping only a subset of l its units, but allowing these units to move by a small amount controlled by . It is a form of n-width similar to Kolmogorov width Donoho (2006) and is also related to robust sparse coding from Tang et al. (2013); Ekanadham et al. (2011).",

Given two parameter values A = (WA1 ,W A 2 ) W and B = (WB1 ,WB2 ) with Fo( A,B) , we show that there exists a continuous path : [0, 1] W connecting A and B such that its oracle risk is uniformly bounded by max(, ), where decreases with model overparametrization. Theorem 2.4.

Some remarks are in order. First, our regularization term is currently a mix between `2 norm constraints on the first layer and `1 norm constraints on the second layer. We believe this is an artifact of our proof technique, and we conjecture that more general regularizations yield similar results. Next, this result uses the data distribution through the oracle bound e(m) and the covariance term. The extension to empirical risk is accomplished by replacing the probability measure P by the empirical measure P = 1L l ((x, y) (xl, yl)). However, our asymptotic analysis has to be carefully reexamined to take into account and avoid the trivial regime when M outgrows L. A consequence of Theorem 2.4 is that as m increases, the model becomes asymptotically connected, as proven in the following corollary. Corollary 2.5. As m increases, the energy gap satisfies = O(m 1n ) and therefore the level sets become connected at all energy levels. This is consistent with the overparametrization results from Safran & Shamir (2015); Shamir (2016) and the general common knowledge amongst deep learning practitioners. Our next sections explore this question, and refine it by considering not only topological properties but also some rough geometrical measure of the level sets.",

A sensible measure of this ease-of-connectedness is the normalized length of the geodesic connecting one model to the other: |A,B(t)|/|A B |. This length represents approximately how far of an excursion one must make in the space of models relative to the euclidean distance between a pair of models. Thus, convex models have a geodesic length of 1, because the geodesic is simply linear interpolation between models, while more non-convex models have geodesic lengths strictly larger than 1. Because calculating the exact geodesic is difficult, we approximate the geodesic paths via a dynamic programming approach we call Dynamic String Sampling. We comment on alternative algorithms in Appendix A. For a pair of models with network parameters i, j , each with Fe() below a threshold L0, we aim to efficienly generate paths in the space of weights where the empirical loss along the path remains below L0. These paths are continuous curves belonging to F ()that is, the level sets of the loss function of interest.

In general, the problem of determining if two models are connected can be made arbitrarily difficult by choice of a particularly pathological geometry for the loss function, so we are constrained to heuristic arguments for determining when to stop running the algorithm. Thankfully, in practice, loss function geometries for problems of interest are not intractably difficult to explore. We comment more on diagnosing disconnections more carefully in Appendix E. Further, if the MaxError exceeds L0 for every new recursive branch as the algorithm progresses, the worst case runtime scales as O(exp(Depth)). Empirically, we find that the number of new models added at each depth does grow, but eventually saturates, and falls for a wide variety of models and architectures, so that the typical runtime is closer to O(poly(Depth))at least up until a critical value of L0. To aid convergence, either of the choices in line 7 of the algorithm works in practicechoosing t at a local maximum can provide a modest increase in algorithm runtime, but can be unstable if the the calculated interpolated loss is particularly flat or noisy. t = .5 is more stable, but slower.

On the other hand, we have introduced a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently approximates geodesics within each level set, providing a tool that not only verifies the connectedness of level sets, but also estimates the geometric regularity of these sets. Thanks to this information, we can quantify how non-convex an optimization problem is, and verify that the optimization of quintessential deep learning tasks CIFAR-10 and MNIST classification using CNNs, and next word prediction using LSTMs behaves in a nearly convex fashion up until they reach high accuracy levels. That said, there are some limitations to our framework. In particular, we do not address saddle-point issues that can greatly affect the actual convergence of gradient descent methods. There are also a number of open questions; amongst those, in the near future we shall concentrate on: Extending Theorem 2.4 to the multilayer case. We believe this is within reach, since the main analytic tool we use is that small changes in the parameters result in small changes in the covariance structure of the features. That remains the case in the multilayer case. Empirical versus Oracle Risk. A big limitation of our theory is that right now it does not inform us on the differences between optimizing the empirical risk versus the oracle risk. Understanding the impact of generalization error and stochastic gradient in the ability to do small uphill climbs is an open line of research. Influence of symmetry groups. Under appropriate conditions, the presence of discrete symmetry groups does not prevent the loss from being connected, but at the expense of increasing the capacity. An important open question is whether one can improve the asymptotic properties by relaxing connectedness to being connected up to discrete symmetry. Improving numerics with Hyperplane method. Our current numerical experiments employ a greedy (albeit faster) algorithm to discover connected components and estimate geodesics. We plan to perform experiments using the less greedy algorithm described in Appendix A.",

      "text": "While the algorithm presented in Sec. 3.1 is fast for sufficiently smooth families of loss surfaces with few saddle points, here we present a slightly modified version which, while slower, provides more control over the convergence of the string. We did not use the algorithm presented in this section for our numerical studies. Instead of training intermediate models via full SGD to a desired accuracy as in step 8 of the algorithm, intermediate models are be subject to a constraint that ensures they are close to the neighboring models on the string. Specifically, intermediate models are constrained to the unique hyperplane in weightspace equidistant from its two neighbors. This can be further modified by additional regularization terms to control the springy-ness of the string. These heuristics could be chosen to try to more faithfully sample the geodesic between two models. In practice, for a given model on the string, i, these two regularizations augment the standard loss by: F () = F () + (i1 i+ i+1 i) + (i1i+1)/2(i1i+1)/2 (i(i1i+1)/2) (i(i1i+1)/2). The regularization term controls the springy-ness of the weightstring, and the regularization term controls how far off the hyperplane a new model can deviate. Because adapting DSS to use this constraint is straightforward, here we will describe an alternative breadth-first approach wherein models are trained in parallel until convergence. This alternative approach has the advantage that it will indicate a disconnection between two models sooner in training. The precise geometry of the loss surface will dictate which approach to use in practice. Given two random models i and j where |i j | < L0, we aim to follow the evolution of the family of models connecting i to j . Intuitively, almost every continuous path in the space of random models connecting i to j has, on average, the same (high) loss. For simplicity, we choose to initialize the string to the linear segment interpolating between these two models. If this entire segment is evolved via gradient descent, the segment will either evolve into a string which is entirely contained in a basin of the loss surface, or some number of points will become fixed at a higher loss. These fixed points are difficult to detect directly, but will be indirectly detected by the persistence of a large interpolated loss between two adjacent models on the string. The algorithm proceeds as follows: (0.) Initialize model string to have two models, i and j . 1. Begin training all models to the desired loss, keeping the instantaneous loss, L0(t), of all models being trained approximately constant. 2. If the pairwise interpolated loss between n and n+1 exceeds L0(t), insert a new model at the maximum of the interpolated loss (or halfway) between these two models. 3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) until all models (and interpolated errors) are below a threshold loss L0(tfinal) := L0, or until a chosen failure condition (see 3.2).",

      "text": "B.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2.1 Suppose that 1 is a local minima and 2 is a global minima, but F (1) > F (2). If = F (1), then clearly 1 and 2 both belong to F (). Suppose now that F () is connected. Then we could find a smooth (i.e. continuous and differentiable) path (t) with (0) = 1, (1) = 2 and F ((t)) = F (1). But this contradicts the strict local minima status of 1, and therefore F () cannot be connected . B.2 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2.2 Let us first consider the case with = 0. We proceed by induction over the number of layers K. For K = 1, the loss F () is convex. Let A, B be two arbitrary points in a level set . Thus F (A) and F (B) . By definition of convexity, a linear path is sufficient in that case to connect A and B : F ((1 t)A + tB) (1 t)F (A) + tF (B) . Suppose the result is true for K 1. Let A = (WA1 , . . . ,WAK ) and B = (WB1 , . . . ,WBK ) with F (A) , F (B) . Since nj min(n1, nK) for j = 2 . . .K 1, we can find k = 1,K 1 such that nk min(nk1, nk+1). For each W1, . . . ,WK , we denote Wj = Wj for j 6= k, k 1 and Wk = Wk1Wk . By induction hypothesis, the loss expressed in terms of = (W1, . . . , WK1) is connected between A and B . Let Wk(t) the corresponding linear path projected in the layer k. We need to produce a path in the variables Wk1(t), Wk(t) such that: i Wk1(0) = WAk1, Wk1(1) = W B k1, ii Wk(0) = WAk , Wk(1) = W B k , iii Wk(t)Wk1(t) = Wk1(t) for t (0, 1). We construct it as follows. Let Wk(t) = tW B k + (1 t)WAk + t(1 t)V , Wk1(t) = Wk(t) Wk1(t) , where Wk(t) = (Wk(t)TWk(t))1Wk(t)T denotes the pseudoinverse and V is a nk1nk matrix drawn from a iid distribution. Conditions (i) and (ii) are immediate from the definition, and condition (iii) results from the fact that Wk(t)Wk(t) = INk , since W k (t) has full rank for all t (0, 1). Finally, let us prove that the result is also true when K = 2 and > 0. We construct the path using the variational properties of atomic norms Bach (2013). When we pick the ridge regression regularization, the corresponding atomic norm is the nuclear norm: X = min UV T=X 1 2 (U2 + V 2) . The path is constructed by exploiting the convexity of the variational norm X. Let A = (WA1 ,W A 2 ) and B = (WB1 ,W B 2 ), and we define W = W1W2. Since W A,B = W A,B 1 W A,B 2 , it results that W A,B 1 2 (W A,B1 2 + W A,B 2 2) . (12) From (12) it results that the loss Fo(W1,W2) can be minored by another loss expressed in terms of W of the form E|Y WX|2+ 2W , which is convex with respect to W . Thus a linear path in W from WA to WB is guaranteed to be below Fo(A,B). Let us define t , W1(t),W2(t) = arg min UV T=W (t) (U2 + V 2) . One can verify that we can first consider a path (A1 (s), A 2 (s)) from (W A 1 ,W A 2 ) to (W1(0),W2(0) such that s 1(s)2(s) = WA and 1(s)2 + 2(s)2 decreases , and similarly for (WB1 ,W B 2 ) to (W1(1),W2(1). The path ( A 1,2(s),W1,2(t), B 1,2(s)) satisfies (i-iii) by definition. We also verify that W1(t)2 + W2(t)2 = 2W (t) 2(1 t)W (0) + 2tW (1) (1 t)(W21(0) + W22(0)) + t(W21(1) + W22(1)) . Finally, we verify that the paths we have just created, when applied to A arbitrary and B = a global minimum, are strictly decreasing, again by induction. For K = 1, this is again an immediate consequence of convexity. ForK > 1, our inductive construction guarantees that for any 0 < t < 1, the path (t) = (Wk(t))kK satisfies Fo((t)) < Fo(A). This concludes the proof . B.3 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2.3 Let A(w1, w2) = x Rn; x,w1 0 , x,w2 0 . By definition, we have w1, w2Z = Emax(0, X,w1) max(0, X,w2) (13) = A(w1,w2) x,w1x,w2dP (x) , (14) = Q(A(w1,w2)) Q(x), w1Q(x), w2(dP (Q(x))) , (15) whereQ is the orthogonal projection onto the space spanned byw1 andw2 and dP (x) = dP (x1, x2) is the marginal density on that subspace. Since this projection does not interfere with the rest of the proof, we abuse notation by dropping the Q and still referring to dP (x) as the probability density. Now, let r = 12w1 + w2 = 1+cos() 2 and d = w2w1 2 . By construction we have w1 = rwm d , w2 = rwm + d , and thus x,w1x,w2 = r2|x,wm|2 |x, d|2 . (16) By denoting C(wm) = x Rn; x,wm 0, observe that A(w1, w2) C(wm). Let us denote by B = C(wm) (w1, w2) the disjoint complement. It results that w1, w2Z = A(w1,w2) x,w1x,w2dP (x) = C(wm) [r2|x,wm|2 |x, d|2]dP (x) r2 B |x,wm|2dP (x) + B |x, d|2dP (x) = r2wm2Z r2 B |x,wm|2dP (x)} {{ } E1 A(w1,w2) |x, d|2dP (x)} {{ } E2 . (17) We conclude by bounding each error term E1 and E2 separately: 0 E1 r2| sin()|2 B x2dP (x) r2| sin()|22X , (18) since every point in B by definition has angle greater than /2 from wm. Also, 0 E2 d2 A(w1,w2) x2dP (x) 1 cos() 2 2X (19) by direct application of Cauchy-Schwartz. The proof is completed by plugging the bounds from (18) and (19) into (17) . B.4 PROOF OF THEOREM 2.4 Consider a generic and l m. A path from A to B will be constructed by concatenating the following paths: 1. from A to lA, the best linear predictor using the same first layer as A, 2. from lA to sA, the best (m l)-term approximation using perturbed atoms from A, 3. from sA to the oracle l term approximation, 4. from to sB , the best (m l)-term approximation using perturbed atoms from B , 5. from sB to lB , the best linear predictor using the same first layer as B , 6. from lB to B . The proof will study the increase in the loss along each subpath and aggregate the resulting increase into a common bound. Subpaths (1) and (6) only involve changing the parameters of the second layer while leaving the firstlayer weights fixed, which define a convex loss. Therefore a linear path is sufficient to guarantee that the loss along that path will be upper bounded by on the first end and WA1 (m, 0,m) on the other end. Concerning subpaths (3) and (4), we notice that they can also be constructed using only parameters of the second layer, by observing that one can fit into a single n m parameter matrix both the (m l)-term approximation and the oracle l-term approximation. Indeed, let us describe subpath (3) in detail ( subpath (4) is constructed analogously by replacing the role of sA with sB). Let WA the first-layer parameter matrix associated with the m l-sparse solution sA, and let A denote its second layer coefficients, which is a m-dimensional vector with at most m l non-zero coefficients. LetW be the first-layer matrix of the l-term oracle approximation, and the corresponding second-layer coefficients. Since there are only m l columns of WA that are used, corresponding to the support of A, we can consider a path that replaces the remaining l columns with those from W while keeping the second-layer vector A fixed. Since the modified columns correspond to zeros in A, such paths have constant loss. Call W the resulting first-layer matrix, containing both the active m l active columns of WA and the l columns of W in the positions determined by the zeros of A. Now we can consider the linear subpath that interpolates between A and while keeping the first layer fixed at W . Since again this is a linear subpath that only moves second-layer coefficients, it is non-increasing thanks to the convexity of the loss while fixing the first layer. We easily verify that at the end of this linear subpath we are using the oracle l-term approximation, which has loss e(l), and therefore subpath (3) incurs in a loss that is bounded by its extremal values WA1 (m l, ,m) and e(l). Finally, we need to show how to construct the subpaths (2) and (5), which are the most delicate step since they cannot be bounded using convexity arguments as above. Let WA be the resulting perturbed first-layer parameter matrix withm l sparse coefficients A. Let us consider an auxiliary regression of the form W = [WA; WA] Rn2m . and regression parameters 1 = [1; 0] , 2 = [0; A] . Clearly E|Y 1W |2+ 11 = E|Y 1WA|2+ 11 and similarly for 2. By convexity, the augmented linear path (t) = (1 t)1 + t2 thus satisfies t , L(t) = E|Y (t)W |2+ (t)1 max(L(0), L(1)) . Let us now approximate this augmented linear path with a path in terms of first and second layer weights. We consider 1(t) = (1 t)WA + tWA , and 2(t) = (1 t)1 + tA . We have that Fo(1(t), 2(t)) = E|Y 2(t)Z(1(t))|2+ 2(t)1 (20) E|Y 2(t)Z(1(t))|2+ ((1 t)11 + tA1) = L(t) + E|Y 2(t)Z(1(t))|2 E|Y (1 t)1Z(WA) tAZ(WA)|2 . (21) Finally, we verify thatE|Y 2(t)Z(1(t))|2 E|Y (1 t)1Z(WA) tAZ(WA)|2 (22) 4max(E|Y |2, E|Y 2|)X(1/2 + E|Y 2|1) + o(2) . Indeed, from Proposition 2.3, and using the fact that i M, t [0, 1] , ((1 t)wAi + twAi ;wAi ) , ((1 t)wAi + twAi ; wAi ) we can write (1 t)1,iz(wAi ) + tA,iz(wAi ) d = 2(t)iz(1(t)i) + ni , with E|ni|2 4|2(t)i|2X2 + O(4) and E|ni| 2|2(t)i| X using concavity of the moments. ThusE|Y 2(t)Z(1(t))|2 E|Y (1 t)1Z(WA) tAZ(WA)|2 2E i (Y 2(t)Z(1(t)))ni + E | i ni|2 4 ( E|Y 2|X2+ 2(21)2X ) 4max(1, E|Y 2|)X(21 + 221) + o(2) 4max( E|Y 2|,E|Y 2|)X(1 + E|Y 2|2) + o(2) , which proves (22). We have just constructed a path from A to B , in which all subpaths except (2) and (5) have energy maximized at the extrema due to convexity, given respectively by , W 1A(m, 0,m), W 1A(m l, ,m), e(l), W 1B (m l, ,m), and W 1B (m, 0,m). For the two subpaths (2) and (5), (22) shows that it is sufficient to add the corresponding upper bound to the linear subpath, which is of the form C + o(2) where C is an explicit constant independent of . Since l and are arbitrary, we are free to pick the infimum, which concludes the proof. B.5 PROOF OF COROLLARY 2.5 Let us consider a generic first layer weight matrix W Rnm. Without loss of generality, we can assume that wk = 1 for all k, since increasing the norm of wkwithin the unit ball has no penalty in the loss, and we can compensate this scaling in the second layer thanks to the homogeneity of the half-rectification. Since this results in an attenuation of these second layer weights, they too are guaranteed not to increase the loss. From Vershynin (2010) [Lemma 5.2] we verify that the covering number N (Sn1, ) of the Euclidean unit sphere Sn1 satisfies N (Sn1, ) ( 1 + 2 )n , which means that we can cover the unit sphere with an -net of size N (Sn1, ). Let 0 < < n1(1 + n1)1, and let us pick, for each m, m = m 1 n . Let us consider its corresponding -net of size um = N (Sn1, m) ' ( 1 + 2 m )n ' m1 . Since we have m vectors in the unit sphere, it results from the pigeonhole principle that at least one element of the net will be associated with at least vm = mu1m ' m vectors; in other words, we are guaranteed to find amongst our weight vector W a collection Qm of vm ' m vectors that are all at an angle at most 2 m apart. Let us now apply Theorem 2.4 by picking n = vm and = m. We need to see that the terms involved in the bound all converge to 0 as m. The contribution of the oracle error e(vm) e(m) goes to zero as m by the fact that limm e(m) exists (it is a decreasing, positive sequence) and that vm . Let us now verify that (m vm, m,m) also converges to zero. We are going to prune the first layer by removing one by one the vectors in Qm. Removing one of these vectors at a time incurs in an error of the order of m. Indeed, let wk be one of such vectors and let be the solution of min E() = min =(f ;k)Rk E|Y Tf Z(Wk) kz(wk)|2+ (f1 + |k|) , where Wk is a shorthand for the matrix containing the rest of the vectors that have not been discarded yet. Removing the vector wk from the first layer increases the loss by a factor that is upper bounded by E(p) E(), where (p)j = j for j < k 1 , k1 + k otherwise. , since now p is a feasible solution for the pruned first layer. Let us finally bound E(p) E(). Since (wk, wk1) m, it results from Proposition 2.3 that z(wk) d = z(wk1) + n , with E|n|2 C2 for some constantC independent ofm. By redefining p1 = Y Tp Z(Wk) 1 2n and p2 = 1 2n, we have E|Y Tp Z(Wk)|2 E|Y T Z(Wk) kz(wk)|2 = E|p1 + p2|2 E|p1 p2|2 = 4E|p1p2| EY Tp Z(Wk) 12n 2 E|n|2 (C + ) ' m , where C only depends on E|Y |2. We also verify that p1 1. It results that removing |Qm| of such vectors incurs an increase of the loss at most |Qm| m ' mm 1 n = m+ 1 n . Since we picked such that + 1n < 0, this term converges to zero. The proof is finished.",

This was done by vectorizing all of the weight matrices for all the beads for a given connecting path, and then performing principal component analysis to find the three highest weight projections for the collection of models that define the endpoints of segments for a connecting pathi.e., the i discussed in the algorithm. We then projected the connecting string of models onto these three directions. The color of the strings was chosen to be representative of the test loss under a log mapping, so that extremely high test loss mapped to red, whereas test loss near the threshold mapped to blue.
