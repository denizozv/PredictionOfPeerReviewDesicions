Though successful on many tasks, deep learning approaches tends to be notoriously data-hungry. Recently, feature penalty regularization has been proved effective on capturing new concepts. In this work, we provide both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis on how and why these methods work. We also propose a better design of cost function with improved performance.

      "text": "The current success of deep learning hinges on the ability to apply gradient-based optimization to high-capacity models. It has achieved impressive results on many large-scale supervised tasks such as image classification Krizhevsky et al. (2012); He et al. (2016) and speech recognition Yu & Deng (2012). Notably, these models are extensively hungry for data. In contrast, human beings have strong ability to learn novel concepts efficiently from very few or even one example. As pointed out in Lake et al. (2016), human learning is distinguished by its richness and efficiency. To test whether machines can approach this goal, Lake et al. propose the invaluable Omniglot hand-written character classification benchmark Lake et al. (2011), where each training class has very few examples and the ability to fast-learn is evaluated on never-seen classes with only one example. There has been previous work on attaining rapid learning from sparse data, denoted as meta-learning or learning-to-learn Thrun. (1998); Baxter. (1998). Although used in numerous senses, the term generally refers to exploiting meta-knowledge within a single learning system across tasks or algorithms. In theory, a meta-learning is able to identify the right inductive bias shifts from previous experiences given enough data and many tasks Baxter. (1998). However, even if a well-designed convolutional neural network is a good inductive bias shift for a visual recognition task, it is still elusive to find the optimal parameter from a small training set without any prior knowledge. To alleviate this issue, low-shot learning methods have been proposed to transfer knowledge from various priors to avoid over-fitting, such as Bart & Ullman (2005). Recently, Hariharan & Girshick. (2016) propose a novel prior of gradient penalty, which works pretty well experimentally. Although an intuitive explanation is provided in Hariharan & Girshick. (2016) that a good solution of the network parameters should be stable with small gradients, it is mysterious why adding such a regularization magically improves the low-shot task by a large margin. Mathematical derivation shows that gradient penalty is closely related to regularizing the feature representation. In this paper, we give more analysis, both empirically and theoretically, on why adding a gradient regularization, or feature penalty performs so well. Moreover, we carefully carry out two case studies: (1) the simplest non-linear-separable XOR classification, and (2) a two-layer linear network for regression. The study does give insight on how the penalty centers feature representations and make the learning task easier. Furthermore, we also theoretically show that adding another finallayer weight penalty is necessary to achieve better performance. To be added, close scrutiny reveals its inherent connection with batch normalization Ioffe & Szegedy (2015). From a Bayesian point of view, feature penalty essentially introduces a Gaussian prior which softly normalizes the feature representation and eases the following learning task.",

      "text": "There is a huge body of literature on one-shot learning and it is beyond the scope of this paper to review the entire literature. We only discuss papers that introduce prior knowledge to adjust the neural network learning process, as that is the main focus of this work. Prior knowledge, or inductive bias Thrun. (1998), plays an important role in one-shot or low-shot learning. To reduce over-fitting problems, we need to regularize the learning process. Common techniques include weight regularization Bishop (1995). Recently in Hariharan & Girshick. (2016), a gradient penalty is introduced, which works well experimentally in low-shot scenarios. Various forms of feature regularization have been proposed to improve generalization: Dropout Srivastava et al. (2014) is effective to reduce over-fitting, but has been eschewed by recent architectures such as batch-normalization Ioffe & Szegedy (2015) and ResNets He et al. (2016). Other forms have also been proposed to improve transfer learning performance, such as minimizing the correlation of features Cogswell et al. (2016) and the multiverse loss Littwin & Wolf (2015) . Our work is also closely related to metric learning and nearest neighbor methods, in which representations from previous experience are applied in cross-domain settings Fink (2005); Koch et al. (2015); Goldberger et al. (2005); Chopra et al. (2005). The insight lies in that a well-trained representational model have strong ability to generalize well on new tasks. In a recent work Santoro et al. (2016), DeepMind proposed a Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) to leverage the Neural-Turing-Machine for one-shot tasks. However, in Vinyals et al. (2016), it is found that a good initialization such as VGG-Net largely improves the one-shot performance. In our opinion, a good feature representations still play a central role in low-shot tasks.",

      "text": "We briefly introduce the notations in our work: we denote uppercase A, bold a and lowercase a for matrices, vectors and scalars respectively. For a vector ai, we denotes ai,j as its j-th element. ||.||F stands for the Frobenius norm of a matrix. Given N examples (xi, yi)|i = 1, ..., N, we define E. as an expectation taken with respect to the empirical distribution generated by the training set. Following Hariharan & Girshick. (2016), we aim to learn a neural network model to extract the feature representations (xi) and make predictions yi = W(xi) with W = [w1, ...,w|C|]. This setting includes both classification and regression problems, with |C| as the number of classes or target dimension, respectively. The problem can be generally formulated as: W , = arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) (1) where l(.) can be any reasonable cost function. In this paper, we focus on cross-entropy and L2 loss due to their convexity and universality. In Hariharan & Girshick. (2016), it is suggested that adding a squared gradient magnitude loss (SGM) on every sample can regularize the learning process. W , = arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) + ||W l(W,(xi, yi))||2 (2) The insight is that for a good solution, the parameter gradient should be small at convergence. However, we know that the convergence of a neural network optimization is a dynamic equilibrium. In other words, at a stationary point, we should have EW l(W,(x)) 0. Intuitively when close to convergence, about half of the data-cases recommend to update a parameter to move positive, while the other half recommend to move negative. It is not very clear why small gradients on every sample E||W l(W,(x))||2 produces good generalization experimentally. Mathematical derivation shows that the optimization problem with gradient penalty is equivalent with adding a weighted L2 regularizer (xi): arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) + i||(xi)||2 (3) where the example-dependent i measures the deviation between the prediction yi and the target yi. In a regression problem, we have i = r2 = ||yi yi||2, with the residual r = yi yi; in a classification problem, we have i = k(p i k I(yi = k))2. Intuitively, the misclassified high-norm examples might be outliers, and in a low-shot learning scenario, such outliers can pull the learned weight vectors far away from the right solution. In Hariharan & Girshick. (2016), the authors compare dropping i and directly penalizing ||(xi)||2, which performs almost equally well. In our work, we argue that a better and more reasonable design should be: arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) + 1i||(xi)||2+ 2||W ||2F (4) where we add another weight regularizer ||W ||2F , which is necessary to avoid degenerate solutions. We will give further explanation in our second case study. In following analysis, we denote the cost in Eqn(4) with example-dependent i as weighted L2 feature penalty, and the example-independent (setting i 1) as uniform L2 feature penalty. We carry out two case studies: (1) an XOR classification and (2) a regression problem, both empirically and theoretically to analyze how the uniform and weighted L2 feature penalty regularize the neural network. In our paper, we will focus on the uniform feature regularization and will also cover the weighted scenario as well.",

Suppose that we have four two-dimensional input points x = [x1, x2]T R2: x1 = [1, 1]T ,x2 = [0, 0]T C+ belongs to the positive class, while x3 = [1, 0]T ,x4 = [0, 1]T C the negative. As shown in Figure 1, we use a three-layer neural network to address the problem (left figure): h1 = x + b is a translation with b = [b1, b2]T R2 as the offset; h2 = h1,1 h1,2 is a non-linear layer, multiplying the first and second dimension of h1 and producing a scalar; y is a linear classifier on h2 parametrized by w. The original classification problem can be formulated as: arg min w1,b,w 4 i=1 log(1 + exp(yi w hi2)) Suppose that we start from an initialization b = [0, 0]T , all three samples x2,x3,x4 from different classes will produce the same representation h2 = 0, which is not separable at all. It takes efforts to tune the learning rate to back-propagate w,b updates from the target y. However, if we introduce the uniform L2 feature regularization as: arg min w1,b,w 4 i=1 log(1 + exp(yiwhi2)) + 1 2 ||hi2||2 Then, we have: 1 2 ||h2||2 b = 1 ( Eh2(x2 + b2) Eh1(x1 + b1) ) (5) the gradient descent pulls Eqn(5) towards zero, i.e., pulling b towards b1 = Ex1 = 0.5 and b2 = Ex2 = 0.5. As shown on the right of Figure 1, the gradient of feature regularization pulls h1 along the direction of red arrows. Then, we have h2 > 0 for positive examples and h2 < 0 for negative ones, which means h2 is linearly-separable. In summary, we can observe that: Empirically, the feature regularization centers the representation h2 = (x) and makes the following classification more learnable. For the weighted case, the offset b have similar effects. It can be derived that when converged the feature representation will satisfy Eh1 = 0 and Eh2=0.",

      "text": "Next, we analyze a two-layer linear neural network as shown in Figure 2. Denoting the input as X = [x1,x2, ...] and the target as Y = [y1,y2, ...]. The regression loss can be formulated as: E||y W2W1x||2 where the latent feature is h = (x) = W1x. The optimization of W1,W2 in this multi-layer linear neural network is not trivial, since it satisfies following properties: 1. The regression loss is non-convex and non-concave. It is convex on W1 (or W2) when the other parameter W2 (or W1) is fixed, but not convex on both simultaneously; 2. Every local minimum is a global minimum; 3. Every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point; 4. IfW2W1 is full-rank, the Hessian at any saddle point has at least one negative eigenvalue. We refer interested readers to Baldi & Hornik (1989); Kawaguchi (2016) for detailed analysis. In case of the uniform L2 feature penalty, the problem becomes: E(W1,W2) = E 1 2 ||y W2W1x||2 + 1 2 ||W1x||2+ 2 2 ||W2||2F (6) At the global minimum W 1 ,W 2 , we should have: E W1 |W1 = W T 2 xy WT2 W2W1xx + 1W1xx = 0 (7) E W2 |W2 = xyW T 1 W2W1xxWT1 + 2W2 = 0 (8) where we define the variance and covariance matrix as xx = ExxT , xy = EyxT . Carrying out Eqn(7) WT1 WT2 Eqn(8) = 0 reveals a very interesting conclusion: 1E||W1x||2 = 2||W2||2F (9) This reads as the expected L2 feature penalty should be equal to final-layer weight regularizer when converged. Or equivalently, when close to convergence, the L2 feature penalty reduces overfitting by implicitly penalizing the corresponding weight matrix W . A more generalized form is: Lemma 1 For a cost function of form in Eqn (4) with uniform L2 feature regularization: arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) + 1||(xi))||2+ 2||W ||2F we have: 1E||(x)||2 = 2||W ||2F (10) The (.) can take a quite general form of a convolutional neural network with many common nonlinear operations such as the ReLU, max-pooling and so on. One can follow the derivation of Eqn(9) to easily derive Lemma 1. Lemma 1 also reveals the importance of adding the weight penalty ||W ||2F in Eqn(4). If we only include the the feature penalty and drop the weight penalty (2 = 0 in our case), then a scaling as (.) = (.) and W = 1W with < 1 will always decrease the energy and the solution will become very ill-conditioned with 0.",

We study a special case x Rd, y RwithW1 R1m,W2 R and include offsets b1 R and b2 R to make the problem more general. Then, the latent representation becomes h = W1x + b1 and the prediction is y = W2h+ b2. The cost function of Eqn(4) becomes: E(W1, b1,W2, b2) = 1 2 E(W2h+ b2 y)2 + 1 2 r2h 2+ 2 2 W 22 (11) We define the prediction residual r and r as y y for better readability, and substitute i = (ri)2. Numerically, we apply a two-step process: in the first step, we calculate the sample-dependent ri in the feed-forward process to obtain our L2 feature regularization weights i for each (xi, yi); in the second step, we treat r as a constant in the optimize. The gradient and Hessian matrix of Eqn(11) can be derived as: E W2 = ErhT + 2W2 E b2 = Er E hi = W2r i + 1(r i ) 2hi E W1 = W2ErxT + 1Er2hxT E b1 = W2Er+ 1Er2h and 2E W 22 = EhhT + 2 2E b22 = 1 2E (hi)2 = W 22 + 1(r i ) 2 2E W 21 = (W 22 + 1Er2)ExxT 2E b21 = W 22 + 1Er2 Suppose that we apply a second-order optimization algorithm for the network parameter w1, w2, b1, b2, the updates should be M = (2E/2)1(E/) with > 0 as the step-size. If we unluckily start from a bad initialization point W2 0, the updates of hi, W1 and b1 are of the form: M hi = (W 22 + 1(ri)2)1(W2ri + 1(ri)2hi) M w1 = [(W 22 + 1Er2)ExxT ]1 (W2Er+ 1Er2h)Ex M b1 = (W 22 + 1Er2)1(W2Er+ 1Er2h) The updates will become very ill-conditioned without the regularization term (1 = 0), since spectrum of the Hessian matrix is two-orders of infinitesimal O(W 22 ) and the gradient is of one-order O(W2). In comparison, with a reasonable choice of 1 > 0, the computation can be largely stabilized when Er2 6= 0. When the algorithm finally converges to a local minimum W 1 , b1,W 2 , b2, the expectation of parameter and latent feature should have gradient close to 0: E W2 = ErhT + 2W2 0 E b2 = Er 0 Substituting this in the analysis of b1, we have: E b1 = W2Er+ 1Eh = Eh 0 (12) In other words, the feature penalty centralizes the final hidden layer representation h(x) = (x). Especially, in the uniformL2-feature penalty case, we simply drop in Eqn (12) and have Eh = E(x) 0. In summary, the feature penalty improves the numerical stability of the optimization process in the regression problem. The conclusion also holds for the classification. Similar results for (x) can be extended to deeper multilayer perceptrons with convex differentiable non-linear activation functions such as ReLU and max-pooling. In an m-layer model parametrized by W1,W2, ...,Wm, the Hessian matrix of hidden layers becomes strongly convex by backpropagating from the regularizer ||m1(Wm1 m2(W2 (... 1(W1x))))||2.",

We reveal here that the two methods are indeed closely related in spirit. From the Bayesian point view, we analyze a binary classification problem: the probability of prediction y given x observes a Bernoulli distribution p(y|x, ,W ) = Ber(y|sigm(W(x)), where (x) Rd is a neural network parametrized by and W R1d. Assuming a factorized Gaussian prior on (x) N(0,Diag(21)) and W N(0,Diag(22)), we have the posterior as: p(,W |(xi, yi)) = p((xi, yi)|,W )p()p(W ) i ( 1 1 + eW(xi) )y i ( 1 1 + eW(xi) )1y i exp( ||(x i)||2 221 ) ( 21)d exp( ||W || 2 F 222 ) ( 22)d (13) Applying the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) principle to Eqn(13) leads to the following objective: El(W,(xi), yi) + 1 221 ||(xi)||2+ 1 222 ||W ||2F + C (14) with C = d ln( 21) d ln( 22) is a constant. This is exactly the uniform L2 version of Equation (4) with 1 = 1221 , 2 = 1 222 and i = 1. The i.i.d. Gaussian prior on W and (x) has the effect of whitening the final representation. The difference between uniform L2 feature penalty and batch normalization is that the former whitens (x) implicitly with an i.i.d. Gaussian prior during training, while the latter explicitly normalizes the output by keeping moving average and variance. We could say that the uniform L2 penalty is a soft batch normalization. As analyzed in Wiesler & Ney (2011) this kind of whitening improved the numerical behavior and makes the optimization converge faster.

Denoting the risk functional (testing error) R(W ) as: R(W ) = 1 2 E||y W(x)||2 = 1 2 (x,y)P (x,y) ||y W(x)||2dP (x, y) and empirical risk function (training error) Remp(W ) on (xi, yi)|i = 1, ..., N as: Remp(W ) = 1 2N N i=1 ||yi W(xi)||2 As we know, the training and testing discrepancy depends on the model complexity Vapnik (1998): R(W )Remp(W ) (W ) +O( h ln N ) (15) where O(.) denotes order of magnitude up to logarithmic factor. The upper bound 15 holds true with probability 1 for a chosen 0 < < 1. In the equation, h is a non-negative integer named the VC-dimension. The right side of Eqn 15 contains two term: the first one (W ) is the error on training set while the second one models complexity of the learning system. In a multilayer neural network with parameters and non-linear activations, the system has a VC dimension Sontag (1998) of O( log ). In our model in Eqn 4, the final cost function includes both feature and weight penalty as: arg min W, El(W,(xi), yi) + 1i||(xi)||2+ 2||W ||2F Empirically, the term 2||W ||2F enforces large margin which limits the selection space of W . The term 1||(xi)||2 not only improves numerical stability by feature whitening as discussed in the above sections, but also limits the selection of hidden layer parameter. These regularization terms thus reduces the VC-dimension of our learning.
