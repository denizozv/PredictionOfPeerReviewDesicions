      "text": "Most of neural language models, such as n-gram models Bengio et al. (2003) are word based and rely on the definition of a finite vocabulary V . As a consequence, a Look-up table is associated to V in which each word w V is mapped to a vector of dE real valued features stored in a matrix L R|V|dE . While this approach has proven successful for a variety of tasks and languages, see for instance Schwenk (2007) in speech recognition and Le et al. (2012); Devlin et al. (2014); Bahdanau et al. (2014) in machine translation, it induces several limitations. For morphologically-rich languages, like Czech or German, the lexical coverage is still an important issue, since there is a combinatorial explosion of word forms, most of which are hardly observed on training data. On the one hand, growing the Look-up table is not a solution, since it would increase the number of parameters without having enough training example for a proper estimation. On the other hand, rare words can be replaced by a special token. Nevertheless, this acts as a word class merging very different words without any distinction and using different word classes to handle outof-vocabulary words Allauzen & Gauvain (2005) does not really solve this issue, since rare words are difficult to classify. Moreover, for most inflected or agglutinative forms, as well as for compound words, the word structure is overlooked, wasting parameters for modeling forms that could be more efficiently handled by word decomposition. While the use of subword units Botha & Blunsom (2014); Sennrich et al. (2016) could improve the generalization power of such models, it relies on a proper and efficient method to induce these subword units. To overcome these issues, we propose to investigate a word based language model with an open vocabulary. Since most of existing models and training criteria rely on the assumption of a finite vocabulary, the definition of an open vocabulary model, along with a training criterion, constitutes a scientific challenge. Our goal is to build word representations every words. Word representations are inferred on-the-fly from its character sequence, using convolution filters which implicitly capture subword patterns, as described in section 2. The architecture is based on a neural ngram model inspired from Bengio et al. (2003), while this idea can be extended to other kind of models. By relaxing the normalized constraint, the objective function borrows from the noise contrastive estimation Gutmann & Hyvarinen (2012) to allow our model to consider a possibly infinite vocabulary. This paper focusses on this challenge and its related training issues. To assess the efficiency of this approach, the experimental setup described in section 3 uses a large scale translation task in a reranking setting. The experimental results summarized in section 4 show promising results as well as training issues.",

As illustrated in figure 1, a word w is a character sequence c1, .., c|w| represented by their embeddings Cc1 , ..,Cc|w|, where Cci denotes the vector associated to the character ci.

      "heading": "2.3 OBJECTIVE FUNCTION FOR OPEN VOCABULARY MODELS",
      "text": "Usually, such a model is trained by maximizing the log-likelihood. For a given word given its context, the model parameters are estimated in order to maximize the following function for all the n-grams observed in the training data: LL() = 1<i<|D| logP(wi|Hi). This objective function raises two important issues. For conventional word models, it implies a very costly summation imposed by the softmax activation of the output layer. More importantly, this objective requires the definition of a finite vocabulary, while the proposed model may use characterbased word embeddings, especially at the output, making the notion of vocabulary obsolete. Therefore, the parameters estimation relies on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) introduced in Gutmann & Hyvarinen (2012); Mnih & Teh (2012). This criterion allows us to train both types of models based on conventional word embeddings, along with character-based embeddings. The NCE objective function aims to discriminate between examples sampled from the real data and from a noise distribution. When presented with examples coming from a mixture of one sample from the data distribution Pd and k from the noise distribution Pn, PH(w D) denotes the posterior probability of a word w given its context H to be sampled from the training data D. This probability can be expressed as follows: PH(w D) = P H d (w) PHd (w) + kPn(w) As suggested in Mnih & Teh (2012), Pn only depends on w here, since we chose the unigram distribution estimated on the training data. If sH (w) = exp (e outhH + bout) (2) denotes the non-normalized score given by the model to a specific word w, as a function of the parameters and the context H , the final NCE objective function has the following form Gutmann & Hyvarinen (2012): JH = EsH [ log sH (w) sH(w) + kPn(w) ] + kEPn [ log kPn(w) sH (w) + kPn(w) ] , where sH will tend to P H d without the need for an explicit normalization.",

In this case the model can efficiently represent and infer a score to any word, observed during the training process or not, while with conventional word embeddings, out of vocabulary words only share the same representation and distribution. Instead of using a parameter matrix Wout to estimate the score like in equation 2, the output representation of a word w, eoutw can be replaced by a vector e charout w estimated on the fly based on its character sequence as described in equation 1, using |Vc| dc +dc nc dh parameters. With this extension the model does not rely on a vocabulary anymore, hence motivating our choice of the NCE. This unnormalized objective allows us to handle an open vocabulary, since we only need to compute k+ 1 word representations for each training examples. Models that use character-based embeddings both for input and output words are denoted by CWE-CWE. Moreover, with this extension, the representations of words sharing character n-grams are tied. This is an important property to let the model generalize to unseen words. However, it can be also an issue: the limited number of updates for output representations (k+ 1 words) has a rich get richer effect: the most frequent words are usually short and will get most of the update. They may therefore contaminate the representation of longer words with which they share character n-grams, even if these words are not related. This issue is further addressed in section 4.1.",

To better benefit from the open vocabulary models introduced in section 2.1, a more complex system is also used: first an MT system is used to translate from English to a simplified form of Czech which is reinflected.

To circumvent this limitation, in a similar fashion as the method described in Marie et al. (2015), each noun, pronoun and adjective is replaced in the training corpora by its lemma along with some morphological features. These word forms are considered in factored way, where some of the POS tags are discarded to reduce the vocabulary. After the translation process, a cascade of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are used to reintroduce the discarded features, such as gender, number and case, and to generate a new word form. Formally, the MT system translates English into a simplified version of Czech, that is reinflected. Within this process, the MT system can produce a n-best list, that can be extended to a nk-best list, considering for each translation hypothesis the k-best reinflected sentences given by the factorized CRF. Intuitively, this process can introduce word forms potentially not yet seen in training data, but based on known paradigms, which can give an advantage to language models able to build a word representation from character n-grams.",

We then train using batches of 128, for various context sizes, WE, CWE, and CWE-CWE models. The ReLu activation function is used, along with an embedding size of de = 128.

We suspect that groups of characters are updated far more together, yielding a contamination of several character n-grams by very frequent short words. Indeed, our simple padding scheme, as shown in the left part of table 1, makes words sharing first or last letter(s) systematically share at least one character n-gram: we suppose it gives the models more chance to detect similarities in word forms sharing prefixes and suffixes. The representations of any of the character n-grams that are included in the frequent words will thus be re-used in a large part of the other words in the corpus. A huge number of word forms are affected: a little more than one third of the training data shares its first character n-gram with one of the ten most frequent words, and a little more than one quarter shares its last. While considering varying size of character n-grams when building our word representation, as in Kim et al. (2015), would certainly help, it would increase our computation time. We thus choose to alleviate our padding scheme, as shown on the right part of table 1. We add only one character token at the beginning of the word, and one at the end6. While it may inhibit the capacity of the model to build links between words sharing prefixes or suffixes, it improves results drastically, especially when using character-level outputs, as shown in figure 3.

On figure 2 are shown perplexity values of each model during training. These values are based on a vocabulary containing the 250K most frequent words on the training data - it is also the vocabulary used in the model when relevant. They are computed on the development set after each epoch. An epoch includes 2,5M N-grams sampled from the training data. On table 2 are shown the best perplexity obtained on the development set by each model, during training. Figure 4: Model perplexity measured on the development set during training. The context size is 3 words. Figure 3 shows models based on character-level word representations, with and without complete padding. Models are trained on the same data than Figure 2 but on smaller epochs (250K n-grams). same vocabulary as for other models, and use the unknown tokens for words and characters-based representations. Hence, the perplexity computed is difficult to interpret. The main downside of Adagrad is that the learning rate determined by accumulating the history of past gradients is usually too aggressive and stops learning rather early. We simply reset this history every five epochs to give the model a chance to improve, which explains the flattening followed by small improvements we see for WE and CWE models. We choose to do that reset 2 times, based on previous experiments. Despite adaptive gradient, training of CWE-CWE models stays unstable.",

CWE models gives on average +0.1 BLEU point compared to WE models, while CWE-CWE are0.2 BLEU point under. Doubling the context size consistently improves results of +0.2 BLEU point. Experimental results on reinflected Czech seems to follow a similar trend: CWE models behave a little better than WE models, while CWE-CWE models are under. While simply reranking n-best lists is not as efficient as doing it directly in Czech, reranking nk-best lists extended by the factorized CRF gives a small improvement, reaching an improvement of +0.7 BLEU point. As a general rule, small context models seem to have difficulties with reinflected Czech. The main advantage given by the CWE model is an ability to better rerank nk-best lists.

Diversity is also inhibited by our training algorithm: while we train open-vocabulary models, the negative examples used with Noise-contrastive estimation come from a closed vocabulary. This can related to the nature of the unigram distribution used to sample negative examples.

There is a surge of interest into using character-level information for a wide range of NLP tasks, with improved results in POS Tagging Santos & Zadrozny (2014), Text classification Zhang & LeCun (2015), Parsing Ballesteros et al.

(2015), that uses convolutional networks and pooling to construct a word representation from character n-grams, coupled with highway networks Srivastava et al. (2015), showed on various languages that using characters improves results on the language modeling task (for a small corpus), even more so for languages with complex morphology. A similar architecture was used Jozefowicz et al. (2016) on a larger dataset, conjointly with bi-directional LSTMs, and trained with importance sampling, showing great results. On the study of NNLMs in the context of Machine Translation, we can mention the work of Luong et al. (2015) on the effect of the number of layers on reranking n-best lists.

These models were used to re-rank outputs of translation systems from English to Czech. We also carried out experiments on translation systems from English to a simplified Czech, which is then re-inflected into Czech before re-ranking. We obtained a slight improvement in BLEU score using a CWE model, which, given the little variety of the words generated by translation systems, makes us suppose there is room for more. We plan to investigate with more complex translation systems, as well as with other applications, such as morphological re-inflection. While the performance of our open-vocabulary models are to some extent disappointing, they open questions about the learned representations we will explore. We also plan to investigate on a more fitted noise distribution to use with NCE when training open-vocabulary models.",
