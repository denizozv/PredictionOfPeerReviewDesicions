  "abstract": "Latent representation learned from multi-layered neural networks via hierarchical feature abstraction enables recent success of deep learning. Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation for supervised tasks can be attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables. From this base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables semantic perturbation on the latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled additive noise while preserving its original semantics. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed latent space modeling method including t-SNE visualization.",

      "text": "Enhancing the generalization performance against unseen data given some sample data is the main objective in machine learning. Under that point of view, deep learning has been achieved many breakthroughs in several domains such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016), natural language processing (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Bahdanau et al., 2015), and speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Graves et al., 2013). Deep learning is basically realized on deep layered neural network architecture, and it learns appropriate taskspecific latent representation based on given training data. Better latent representation learned from training data results in better generalization over the future unseen data. Representation learning or latent space modeling becomes one of the key research topics in deep learning. During the past decade, researchers focused on unsupervised representation learning and achieved several remarkable landmarks on deep learning history (Vincent et al., 2010; Hinton et al., 2006; Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009). In terms of utilizing good base features for supervised learning, the base representation learned from unsupervised learning can be a good solution for supervised tasks (Bengio et al., 2007; Masci et al., 2011). The definition of good representation is, however, different according to target tasks. In unsupervised learning, a model is learned from unlabelled examples. Its main objective is to build a model Corresponding author to estimate true data distribution given examples available for training, so the learned latent representation normally includes broadly-informative components of the raw input data (e.g., mutual information between the input and the latent variable can be maximized for this objective). In supervised learning, however, a model is learned from labelled examples. In the case of classification, a supervised model learns to discriminate input data in terms of the target task using corresponding labels. Latent representation is therefore obtained to maximize the performance on the target supervised tasks. Since the meaning of good representations vary according to target tasks (unsupervised or supervised), pre-trained features from the unsupervised model are not be guaranteed to be useful for subsequent supervised tasks. Instead of the two stage learning strategy (unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning), several works focused on a joint learning model which optimizes unsupervised and supervised objectives concurrently, resulting in better generalization performance (Goodfellow et al., 2013; Larochelle & Bengio, 2008a; Rasmus et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Cho & Chen, 2014). In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method for supervised learning as an extension of the joint learning approach. We define a good latent representation of standard feed-forward neural networks under the basis of information theory. Then, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method in order to enhance the generalization performance. The proposed method stochastically perturbs the latent representation of a training example by injecting a modeled semantic additive noise. Since the additive noise is randomly sampled from a pre-defined probability distribution every training iteration, different latent vectors from a single training example can be fully utilized during training. The multiple different latent vectors produced from a single training example are semantically similar under the proposed latent space modeling method, so we can expect semantic augmentation effect on the latent space. Experiments are performed on two datasets; MNIST and CIFAR-10. The proposed model results in better classification performance compared to previous approaches through notable generalization effect (stochastically perturbed training examples well cover the distribution of unseen data).",

      "text": "In a traditional feed-forward neural network model (Figure 1(a)), output Y of input data X is compared with its true label, and the error is propagated backward from top to bottom, which implicitly learns a task-specific latent representation Z of the input X . As an extension of a joint learning approach, an objective to be optimized can be described in general as below (Larochelle & Bengio, 2008b): min Lunsup + Lsup (1) where Lunsup and Lsup are respectively an unsupervised loss and a supervised loss, and and are model parameters to be optimized during training and a loss weighting coefficient, respectively. In terms of modeling Lunsup in Eq. (1), we assume that good latent representation Z is attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables; i.e. the sum of the mutual information between the input X and the Z and the mutual information between the Z and the output Y . Each mutual information is decomposed into an entropy and a conditional entropy terms, so the sum of hierarchical mutual informations is expressed as follows: I(X;Z) + I(Z;Y ) = H(X)H(X|Z) + H(Z)H(Z|Y ) (2) where I(; ) is the mutual information between random variables, and H() and H(|) are the entropy and the conditional entropy of random variables, respectively. Note that the sum of those mutual informations becomes equivalent to the total correlation ofX , Z, and Y under the graphical structure of the general feed-forward model described in Figure 1(a); P (X,Z, Y ) = P (Y |Z)P (Z|X)P (X). The total correlation is equal to the sum of all pairwise mutual informations (Watanabe, 1960). Our objective is to find the model parameters which maximize I(X;Z)+ I(Z;Y ). Since H(X) and H(Z) are non-negative, and H(X) is constant in this case, the lower bound on I(X;Z) + I(Z;Y ) can be reduced to 1: I(X;Z) + I(Z;Y ) H(X|Z)H(Z|Y ) . (3) It is known that maximizing H(X|Z) can be formulated as minimizing the reconstruction error between the input x(i) (i-th example sampled from X) and its reconstruction x(i)R under the general audo-encoder framework (Vincent et al., 2010). Since H(X|Z) + H(Z|Y ) is proportional to the sum of reconstruction errors of x(i) (with its reconstruction x(i)R ) and z (i) (with its reconstruction z (i) R ), the target objective can be expressed as follows (refer to Appendix (A1) for the details of mathematical derivations): min i Lrec(x (i), x (i) R ) + Lrec(z (i), z (i) R ) (4) where Lrec is a reconstruction loss. Figure 1(b) shows the target model obtained from the assumption that good latent representation Z can be obtained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations. Given an input sample x, feed-forward vectors and their reconstructions are attained deterministically by: z = f1(x) y = f2(f1(x)) xR = g1(z) = g1(f1(x)) zR = g2(y) = g2(f2(f1(x)) . (5) 1Although H(Z) is an upper bound of H(Z|Y ), H(Z) is anyway affected by the process of H(Z|Y ) being minimized in Eq. (3). In Section 4, we experimentally show that we can obtain good base model even from the relatively loose lower bound defined in Eq. (3). Given a set of training pairs (x(i), t(i)) where x(i) and t(i) are the i-th input example and its label, target objective in Eq. (1) under the model described in Figure 1(b) can be organized as below (with real-valued input samples, L2 loss LL2 is a proper choice for the reconstruction loss Lrec): min :1,1,2,2 i ( LL2(x (i), x (i) R ) + LL2(z (i), z (i) R ) ) + LNLL(y (i), t(i)) (6) where LNLL is a negative log-likelihood loss for the target supervised task. Note that Eq. (6) represents the proposed-base in our experiment (see Section 4.3).",

      "text": "Based on the architecture shown in Figure 1(b) with the target objective in Eq. (6), we conjecture that stochastic perturbation on the latent space during training helps to achieve better generalization performance for supervised tasks. Figure 1(c) shows this strategy which integrates the stochastic perturbation process during training. Suppose that ZP is a perturbed version of Z, and YP is an output which is feed-forwarded from ZP . Given a latent vector z = f1(x) from an input sample x, z = z + ze and y = f2(z ) (7) where z and y are a perturbed latent vector and its output respectively, and ze is an additive noise used in the perturbation process of z. Based on the architecture shown in Figure 1(c), target objective can be modified as: min :1,1,2,2 i 1 ( LL2(x (i), x (i) R ) + LL2(z (i), z (i) R ) ) + 2LNLL(y (i), t(i)) + LNLL(y (i), t(i)) . (8) Using random additive noise directly on ze is the most intuitive approach (proposed-perturb (random) in Section 4.3). However, preserving the semantics of the original latent representation z cannot be guaranteed under the direct random perturbation on the latent space. While the latent space is not directly interpretable in general, the output logit y of the latent representation z is interpretable, because the output logit is tightly coupled to the prediction of the target label. In order to preserve the semantics of the original latent representation after perturbation, we indirectly model a semantic noise on the latent space by adding small random noise directly on the output space. Based on the output (pre-softmax) logit y, the semantic-preserving variation of y (i.e. y) can be modeled by y = y + ye, where ye is a random noise vector stochastically sampled from a zeromean Gaussian with small standard deviation ; N (0, 2I). Now, the semantic perturbation z can be reconstructed from the random perturbation y through the decoding path g2 in Figure 1(c). From the original output logit y and the randomly perturbed output logit y, semantic additive noise ze on the latent space can be approximately modeled as below: zR = g2(y) zR = g2(y ) = g2(y + ye) ze ' zR zR = g2(y + ye) g2(y) (9) By using the modeled semantic additive noise ze and the original latent representation z, we can obtain the semantic perturbation z as well as its output y via Eq. (7) for our target objective Eq. (8). From the described semantic noise modeling process (proposed-perturb (semantic) in Section 4.3), we expect to achieve better representation on the latent space. The effect of the proposed model in terms of learned latent representation will be explained in more detail in Section 4.4.",

      "text": "Previous works on deep neural networks for supervised learning can be categorized into two types as shown in Figure 2; (a) a general feed-forward neural network model (LeCun et al., 1998; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016), and (b) a joint learning model which optimizes unsupervised and supervised objectives at the same time (Zhao et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Cho & Chen, 2014). Here are the corresponding objective functions: min :1,2 i LNLL(y (i), t(i)) (10) min :1,1,2 i LL2(x (i), x (i) R ) + LNLL(y (i), t(i)) (11) where is a loss weighting coefficient between unsupervised and supervised losses. Since the feed-forward neural network model is normally implemented with multiple layers in a deep learning framework, the joint learning model can be sub-classified into two types according to the type of reconstruction; reconstruction only with the input data x (Eq. (11)) and reconstruction with all the intermediate features including the input data x as follows: min i 0LL2(x(i), x(i)R ) + j jLL2(h (i) j , h (i) jR ) + LNLL(y (i), t(i)) . (12) where h(i)j and h (i) jR are the j-th hidden representation of the i-th training example and its reconstruction. Another type of the joint learning model, a ladder network (Figure 3), was introduced for semisupervised learning (Rasmus et al., 2015). The key concept of the ladder network is to obtain robust features by learning de-noising functions (g) of the representations at every layer of the model via reconstruction losses, and the supervised loss is combined with the reconstruction losses in order to build the semi-supervised model. The ladder network achieved the best performance in semi-supervised tasks, but it is not appropriate for supervised tasks with small-scale training set (experimental analysis for supervised learning on permutation-invariant MNIST is briefly summarized in Appendix (A2)). The proposed model in this work can be extended to semi-supervised learning, but our main focus is to enhance the representational power on latent space given labelled data for supervised learning. We leave the study for semi-supervised learning scenario based on the proposed methodology as our future research.",

Three convolution (33 (2) 32, 33 (2) 64, 33 (2) 96, where each item means the filter kernel size and (stride) with the number of filters) and two fully-connected (the numbers of output nodes are 128 and 10, respectively) layers are used for MNIST. For the permutation-invariant MNIST setting, 784-512- 256-256-128-10 nodes of fully-connected layers are used. Four convolution (55 (1) 64, 33 (2) 64, 33 (2) 64, and 33 (2) 96) and three fully-connected (128, 128, and 10 nodes) layers are used for CIFAR-10. Weights on the decoding (reconstruction) path are tied with corresponding weights on the encoding path as shown in Figure 4 (transposed convolution for the tied convolution layer and transposed matrix multiplication for the tied fully-connected layer). In Figure 4, z is perturbed directly from z by adding Gaussian random noise for random perturbation. For semantic perturbation, z is indirectly generated from y which is perturbed by adding Gaussian random noise on y based on Eq. (9). For perturbation, base activation vector (z is the base vector for the random perturbation and y is the base vector for the semantic perturbation) is scaled to [0.0, 1.0], and the zero-mean Gaussian noise with 0.2 of standard deviation is added (via elementwise addition) on the normalized base activation. This perturbed scaled activation is de-scaled with the original min and max activations of the base vector. Initial learning rates are 0.005 and 0.001 for MNIST and permutation-invariant MNIST, and 0.002 for CIFAR-10, respectively. The learning rates are decayed by a factor of 5 every 40 epochs until the 120-th epoch. For both datasets, the minibatch size is set to 100, and the target objective is optimized using Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a momentum 0.9. All the s for reconstruction losses in Eq.

Input data is first scaled to [0.0, 1.0] and then whitened by the average across all the training examples. In CIFAR-10, random cropping (2424 image is randomly cropped from the original 3232 image) and random horizontal flipping (mirroring) are used for data augmentation.

We compared two different perturbation methods (random and semantic) by visualizing the examples reconstructed from the perturbed latent vectors (Figure 5). Top row is the original examples selected from training set (among 2k per-class training examples), and the rest are the reconstructions of their perturbed latent representations. Based on the architecture described in Figure 1(b), we generated five different perturbed latent representations according to the type of perturbation, and reconstructed the perturbed latent vectors through decoding path for reconstruction. Figure 5(a) and (b) show the examples reconstructed from the random and semantic perturbations, respectively. For both cases, zero-mean Gaussian random noise (0.2 standard deviation) is used for perturbation. As shown in Figure 5(a), random perturbation partially destroys the original semantics; for example, semantics of 1 is mostly destroyed under random perturbation, and some examples of 3 are reconstructed as being similar to 8 rather than its original content 3. Figure 5(b) shows the examples reconstructed from the semantic perturbation. The reconstructed examples show subtle semantic variations while preserving the original semantic contents; for example, thickness difference in 3 (example on the third row) or writing style difference in 8 (openness of the top left corner). Figure 6 shows the overall effect of the perturbation. In this analysis, 100 per-class MNIST examples are used for training. From the trained model based on the architecture described in Figure 1(b), latent representations z of all the 50k examples (among 50k examples, only 1k examples were used for training) are visualized by using t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008). Only the training examples of three classes (0, 1, and 9) among ten classes are depicted as black circles for visual discrimination in Figure 6(a). The rest of the examples which were not used for training (approximately 4.9k examples per class) are depicted as a background with different colors. We treat the colored background examples (not used for training) as a true distribution of unseen data in order to estimate the generalization level of learned representation according to the type of perturbation. Figure 6(b) and (c) show the training examples (100 examples per class with yellow circles) and their perturbed ones (3 sampled from each example with blue crosses) through random and semantic perturbations, respectively. In Figure 6(b), perturbed samples are distributed near the original training examples, but some samples outside the true distribution cannot be identified easily with appropriate classes. This can be explained with Figure 5(a), since some perturbed samples are ambiguous semantically. In Figure 6(c), however, most of the perturbed samples evenly cover the true distribution. As mentioned before, stochastic perturbation with the semantic additive noise during training implicitly incurs the effect of augmentation on the latent space while resulting in better generalization.
