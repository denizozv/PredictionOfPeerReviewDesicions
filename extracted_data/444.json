  "abstract": "Although deep learning models have proven effective at solving problems in natural language processing, the mechanism by which they come to their conclusions is often unclear.   As a result, these models are generally treated as black boxes, yielding no insight of the underlying learned patterns.  In this paper we consider Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate a new approach for tracking the importance of a given input to the LSTM for a given output. By identifying consistently important patterns of words, we are able to distill state of the art LSTMs on sentiment analysis and question answering into a set of representative phrases. This representation is then quantitatively validated by using the extracted phrases to construct a simple, rule-based classifier which approximates the output of the LSTM.",

      "text": "Neural network language models, especially recurrent neural networks (RNN), are now standard tools for natural language processing. Amongst other things, they are used for translation Sutskever et al. (2014), language modelling Jozefowicz et al. (2016), and question answering Hewlett et al. (2016). In particular, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) architecture has become a basic building block of neural NLP. Although LSTMs are regularly used in state of the art systems, their operation is not well understood. Besides the basic desire from a scientific viewpoint to clarify their workings, it is often the case that it is important to understand why a machine learning algorithm made a particular choice. Moreover, LSTMs are computationally intensive compared to discrete models with lookup tables and pattern matching. In this work, we describe a novel method for visualizing the importance of specific inputs for determining the output of an LSTM. We then demonstrate that, by searching for phrases which are consistently important, the importance scores can be used to extract simple phrase patterns consisting of one to five words from a trained LSTM. The phrase extraction is first done in a general document classification framework on two different sentiment analysis datasets. We then demonstrate that it can also be specialized to more complex models by applying it to WikiMovies, a recently introduced question answer dataset. To concretely validate the extracted patterns, we use them as input to a rules-based classifier which approximates the performance of the original LSTM.",

      "text": "There are two lines of related work on visualizing LSTMs. First, Hendrik et al. (2016) and Karpathy et al. (2016) analyse the movement of the raw gate activations over a sequence. Karpathy et al. (2016) is able to identify co-ordinates of ct that correspond to semantically meaningful attributes such as whether the text is in quotes and how far along the sentence a word is. However, most of the cell co-ordinates are harder to interpret, and in particular, it is often not obvious from their activations which inputs are important for specific outputs. Work started during an internship at Facebook AI Research Another approach that has emerged in the literature Alikaniotis et al. (2016) Denil et al. (2015) Bansal et al. (2016) is for each word in the document, looking at the norm of the derivative of the loss function with respect to the embedding parameters for that word. This bridges the gap between high-dimensional cell state and low-dimensional outputs. These techniques are general- they are applicable to visualizing the importance of sets of input coordinates to output coordinates of any differentiable function. In this work, we describe techniques that are designed around the structure of LSTMs, and show that they can give better results in that setting. A recent line of work Li et al. (2016) Hewlett et al. (2016) Rajpurkar et al. (2016) Miller et al. (2016) has focused on neural network techniques for extracting answers directly from documents. Previous work had focused on Knowledge Bases (KBs), and techniques to map questions to logical forms suitable for querying them. Although they are effective within their domain, KBs are inevitably incomplete, and are thus an unsatisfactory solution to the general problem of question-answering. Wikipedia, in contrast, has enough information to answer a far broader array of questions, but is not as easy to query. Originally introduced in Miller et al. (2016), the WikiMovies dataset consists of questions about movies paired with Wikipedia articles.",

A more nuanced approach is obtained by considering the additive decomposition of cT in equation (9), where each term ej can be interpreted as the contribution to the cell state cT by word j. By iterating the equation ct = ftct1 + itct, we get that cT = T i=1 ( T j=i+1 fj)iici = T i=1 ei,T (9) This suggests a natural definition of an alternative score to the i,j , corresponding to augmenting the cj terms with products of forget gates to reflect the upstream changes made to cj after initially processing word j. exp(WihT ) = T j=1 exp ( Wi(oT (tanh( j k=1 ek,T ) tanh( j1 k=1 ek,T ))) ) (10) = T j=1 exp Wi(oT (tanh(( t k=j+1 fk)cj) tanh(( t k=j fk)cj1))) (11) = T j=1 i,j (12)",

As our importance scores introduced above correspond to the contribution of particular words to class predictions, they can be used to score potential patterns by looking at a patterns average contribution to the prediction of a given class relative to other classes. More precisely, given a collection of D documents xi,jNdi=1Dj=1, for a given phrase w1, ..., wk we can compute scores S1, S2 for classes 1 and 2, as well as a combined score S and class C as S1(w1, ..., wk) = Averagej,b k l=1 1,b+l,j |xb+i,j = wi, i = 1, ..., k Averagej,b k l=1 2,b+l,j |xb+i,j = wi, i = 1, ..., k (13) S2(w1, .., wk) = 1 S1(w1, ..., wk) (14) S(w1, ..., wk) = max i (Si(w1, ..., wk)) (15) C(w1, ..., wk) = argmaxi(Si(w1, ..., wk)) (16) where i,j,k denotes i,j applied to document k. The numerator of S1 denotes the average contribution of the phrase to the prediction of class 1 across all occurrences of the phrase. The denominator denotes the same statistic, but for class 2. Thus, if S1 is high, then w1, ..., wk is a strong signal for class 1, and likewise for S2. We propose to use S as a score function in order to search for high scoring, representative, phrases which provide insight into the trained LSTM, and C to denote the class corresponding to a phrase. In practice, the number of phrases is too large to feasibly compute the score of them all. Thus, we approximate a brute force search through a two step procedure. First, we construct a list of candidate phrases by searching for strings of consecutive words j with importance scores i,j > c for any i and some threshold c; in the experiments below we use c = 1.1. Then, we score and rank the set of candidate phrases, which is much smaller than the set of all phrases.",

The word and hidden representations of the LSTM were both set to dimension 200 for WikiMovies, 300 and 512 for Yelp, and 300 and 150 for Stanford Sentiment Treebank. All models were optimized using Adam Kingma & Ba (2015) with the default learning rate of 0.001 using early stopping on the validation set.

(2015), the Yelp review polarity dataset was obtained from the Yelp Dataset Challenge and has train and test sets of size 560,000 and 38,000. The task is binary prediction for whether the review is positive (four or five stars) or negative (one or two stars). The reviews are relatively long, with an average length of 160.1 words. We also used the binary classification task from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) Socher et al. (2013), which has less data with train/dev/test sizes of 6920/872/1821, and is done at a sentence level, so has much shorter document lengths. We report results in Table 1 for seven different models. We report state of the art results from prior work using convolutional neural networks; Kim (2014) for SST and Zhang et al. (2015) for Yelp. We also report our LSTM baselines, which are competitive with state of the art, along with the three different pattern matching models described above. For SST, we also report prior results using bag of words features with Naive Bayes. The additive cell decomposition pattern equals or outperforms the cell-difference patterns, which handily beat the gradient results. This coincides with our empirical observations regarding the information contained within the importance measures, and validates our introduced measure. The differences between measures become more pronounced in Yelp, as the longer document sizes provide more opportunities for false positives. Although our pattern matching algorithms underperform other methods, we emphasize that pure performance is not our goal, nor would we expect more from such a simple model. Rather, the fact that our method provides reasonable accuracy is one piece of evidence, in addition to the qualitative evidence given later, that our word importance scores and extracted patterns contain useful information for understanding the actions of a LSTM.",

Performance is reported using the accuracy of the top hit over all possible answers (all entities), i.e. the hits@1 metric. As shown in Table 2, our LSTM model surpasses the prior state of the art by nearly 4%. Moreover, our automatic pattern matching model approximates the LSTM with less than 6% error, which is surprisingly small for such a simple model, and falls within 2% of the prior state of the art.

Under the additive cell decomposition, it identifies the phrase it stars, as well as the actors name Aqib Khan as being important, a sensible conclusion. Moreover, the vast majority of words are labelled with an importance score of 1, corresponding to irrelevant.
