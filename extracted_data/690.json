  "title": "An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications",
  "abstract": "Since the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a prominent technique in the field of computer vision, the ImageNet classification challenge has played a major role in advancing the state-of-the-art. While accuracy figures have steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has not been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint are an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs.",

      "text": "Since the breakthrough in 2012 ImageNet competition (Russakovsky et al., 2015) achieved by AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) the first entry that used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) several other DNNs with increasing complexity have been submitted to the challenge in order to achieve better performance. In the ImageNet classification challenge, the ultimate goal is to obtain the highest accuracy in a multi-class classification problem framework, regardless of the actual inference time. We believe that this has given rise to several problems. Firstly, it is now normal practice to run several trained instances of a given model over multiple similar instances of each validation image. This practice, also know as model averaging or ensemble of DNNs, dramatically increases the amount of computation required at inference time to achieve the published accuracy. Secondly, model selection is hindered by the fact that different submissions are evaluating their (ensemble of) models a different number of times on the validation images, and therefore the reported accuracy is biased on the specific sampling technique (and ensemble size). Thirdly, there is currently no incentive in speeding up inference time, which is a key element in practical applications of these models, and affects resource utilisation, power-consumption, and latency. This article aims to compare state-of-the-art DNN architectures, submitted for the ImageNet challenge over the last 4 years, in terms of computational requirements and accuracy. We compare these architectures on multiple metrics related to resource utilisation in actual deployments: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. The purpose of this paper is to stress the importance of these figures, which are essential hard constraints for the optimisation of these networks in practical deployments and applications.",

      "heading": "2 METHODS",
      "text": "In order to compare the quality of different models, we collected and analysed the accuracy values reported in the literature. We immediately found that different sampling techniques do not allow for a direct comparison of resource utilisation. For example, central-crop (top-5 validation) errors of a single run of VGG-161 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014) are 8.70% and 10.07% respectively, revealing that VGG-16 performs better than GoogLeNet. When models are run with 10-crop sampling,2 then the errors become 9.33% and 9.15% respectively, and therefore VGG-16 will perform worse than GoogLeNet, using a single central-crop. For this reason, we decided to base our analysis on re-evaluations of top-1 accuracies3 for all networks with a single central-crop sampling technique (Zagoruyko, 2016). For inference time and memory usage measurements we have used Torch7 (Collobert et al., 2011) with cuDNN-v5 (Chetlur et al., 2014) and CUDA-v8 back-end. All experiments were conducted on a JetPack-2.3 NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board (nVIDIA): an embedded visual computing system with a 64-bit ARM R A57 CPU, a 1 T-Flop/s 256-core NVIDIA Maxwell GPU and 4 GB LPDDR4 of shared RAM. We use this resource-limited device to better underline the differences between network architecture, but similar results can be obtained on most recent GPUs, such as the NVIDIA K40 or Titan X, to name a few. Operation counts were obtained using an open-source tool that we developed (Paszke, 2016). For measuring the power consumption, a Keysight 1146B Hall effect current probe has been used with a Keysight MSO-X 2024A 200MHz digital oscilloscope with a sampling period of 2 s and 50 kSa/s sample rate. The system was powered by a Keysight E3645A GPIB controlled DC power supply.",

We analysed the following DDNs: AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), batch normalised AlexNet (Zagoruyko, 2016), batch normalised Network In Network (NIN) (Lin et al., 2013), ENet (Paszke et al., 2016) for ImageNet (Culurciello, 2016), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014), VGG-16 and -19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet-18, -34, -50, -101 and -152 (He et al., 2015), Inception-v3 (Szegedy et al., 2015) and Inception-v4 (Szegedy et al., 2016) since they obtained the highest performance, in these four years, on the ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) challenge. 1 In the original paper this network is called VGG-D, which is the best performing network. Here we prefer to highlight the number of layer utilised, so we will call it VGG-16 in this publication. 2 From a given image multiple patches are extracted: four corners plus central crop and their horizontal mirrored twins. 3 Accuracy and error rate always sum to 100, therefore in this paper they are used interchangeably.",

The newest ResNet and Inception architectures surpass all other architectures by a significant margin of at least 7%. Figure 2 provides a different, but more informative view of the accuracy values, because it also visualises computational cost and number of networks parameters. The first thing that is very apparent is that VGG, even though it is widely used in many applications, is by far the most expensive architecture both in terms of computational requirements and number of parameters. Its 16- and 19-layer implementations are in fact isolated from all other networks. The other architectures form a steep straight line, that seems to start to flatten with the latest incarnations of Inception and ResNet. This might suggest that models are reaching an inflection point on this data set. At this inflection point, the costs in terms of complexity start to outweigh gains in accuracy. We will later show that this trend is hyperbolic.",

We notice that VGG processes one image in a fifth of a second, making it a less likely contender in real-time applications on an NVIDIA TX1. AlexNet shows a speed up of roughly 3 going from batch of 1 to 64 images, due to weak optimisation of its fully connected layers. It is a very surprising finding, that will be further discussed in the next subsection.",

In this work, we used a 200MHz digital oscilloscope with a current probe, as reported in section 2. Other measuring instruments, such as an AC power strip with 2Hz sampling rate, or a GPIB controlled DC power supply with 12Hz sampling rate, did not provide enough bandwidth to properly conduct power measurements. In figure 4 we see that the power consumption is mostly independent with the batch size. Low power values for AlexNet (batch of 1) and VGG (batch of 2) are associated to slower forward times per image, as shown in figure 3.",

This is due the initial memory allocation of the network model which is the large static component and the contribution of the memory required while processing the batch, proportionally increasing with the number of images. In figure 6 we can also notice that the initial allocation never drops below 200MB, for network sized below 100MB, and it is linear afterwards, with respect to the parameters and a slope of 1.30.",

Figure 8 reports that there is no specific power footprint for different architectures. When full resources utilisation is reached, generally with larger batch sizes, all networks consume roughly an additional 11.8W, with a standard deviation of 0.7W. Idle power is 1.30W. This corresponds to the maximum system power at full utilisation. Therefore, if energy consumption is one of our concerns, for example for battery-powered devices, one can simply choose the slowest architecture which satisfies the application minimum requirements.",

      "text": "We note that there is a non-trivial linear upper bound between accuracy and number of inferences per unit time. Figure 9 illustrates that for a given frame rate, the maximum accuracy that can be achieved is linearly proportional to the frame rate itself. All networks analysed here come from several publications, and have been independently trained by other research groups. A linear fit of the accuracy shows all architecture trade accuracy vs. speed. Moreover, chosen a specific inference time, one can now come up with the theoretical accuracy upper bound when resources are fully utilised, as seen in section 3.6. Since the power consumption is constant, we can even go one step further, and obtain an upper bound in accuracy even for an energetic constraint, which could possibly be an essential designing factor for a network that needs to run on an embedded system. As the spoiler in section 3.1 gave already away, the linear nature of the accuracy vs. throughput relationship translates into a hyperbolical one when the forward inference time is considered instead. Then, given that the operations count is linear with the inference time, we get that the accuracy has an hyperbolical dependency on the amount of computations that a network requires.",

Prominent work (Han et al., 2015) exploits this flaw to reduce network file size up to 50, using weights pruning, quantisation and variable-length symbol encoding. It is worth noticing that, using more efficient architectures to begin with may produce even more compact representations. In figure 10 we clearly see that, although VGG has a better accuracy than AlexNet (as shown by figure 1), its information density is worse. This means that the amount of degrees of freedom introduced in the VGG architecture bring a lesser improvement in terms of accuracy. Moreover, ENet (Paszke et al., 2016) which we have specifically designed to be highly efficient and it has been adapted and retrained on ImageNet (Culurciello, 2016) for this work achieves the highest score, showing that 24 less parameters are sufficient to provide state-of-the-art results.",

Our goal is to provide insights into the design choices that can lead to efficient neural networks for practical application, and optimisation of the often-limited resources in actual deployments, which lead us to the creation of ENet or Efficient-Network for ImageNet. We show that accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship: a little increment in accuracy costs a lot of computational time. We show that number of operations in a network model can effectively estimate inference time. We show that an energy constraint will set a specific upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity, in terms of operations counts. Finally, we show that ENet is the best architecture in terms of parameters space utilisation, squeezing up to 13 more information per parameter used respect to the reference model AlexNet, and 24 respect VGG-19.",
